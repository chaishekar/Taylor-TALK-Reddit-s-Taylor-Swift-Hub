"From u/tmfansupport:  
A few updates on the Taylor Swift Eras Tour onsale: ‚Ä¢ There has been historically unprecedented demand with millions showing up to buy tickets for the TaylorSwiftTix Presale. ‚Ä¢ Hundreds of thousands of tickets have been sold. If you have already secured tickets, you are all set. ‚Ä¢ If you are currently in a queue, please hang tight - queues are moving and we are working to get fans through as quickly as possible. ‚Ä¢ West Coast onsales for Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Santa Clara, and Seattle originally scheduled for 10 a.m. PT will now be taking place at 3 p.m. PT. Queues will open 30 minutes prior. ‚Ä¢ The Capital One onsale is being rescheduled to tomorrow at 2 p.m. local venue time ‚Ä¢ All presale codes and links sent via text will still work at that time. Thank you for your patience as we continue managing this huge demand.

I don't agree with some sound decisions (for instance, while Midnight Rain's voice modulation does make the song distinctive, listening to it pulls me out of the song completely. It would have been better to give the acoustics true character.)

The album is definitely ""sonically cohesive"" but I don't think that label adds anything positive to the album, which is about the estimation I had on first listen. Of course I like the songs. But. It doesn't hit like 1989 does.",neutral

I think she‚Äôll keep a very singer-songwriter vibe with this album but maybe explore a bit more with production. I still think it‚Äôll be on the alt/indie side with pop leanings so you might find yourself surprised.",neutral

"I agree because when I first started the album I was like what the f am I hearing and I was like just so thrown like asking questions like ‚Äúwhy all the 70‚Äôs references etc‚Äù. Once I let go of our made up expectations I really enjoyed the album. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs my favorite yet or where it falls but it‚Äôs definitely not near my bottom. I‚Äôve been a fan since debut and actually wouldn‚Äôt even put debut last, and I loved rep right away no grow time, and I loved folklore and evermore. I think if you have wide music tastes you can definitely appreciate all her albums but if you don‚Äôt or you unintentionally give yourself musical tunnel vision with weeks of speculative expectations then it can definitely lead to disappointment and negative associations toward the music. So hopefully once people get over the fleetwood/70‚Äôs expectations then they will hear it and appreciate it properly.",neutral

 ‚ÄúSec FL-X, Row X, Seat X-X   USD $544.00 x2‚Äù. (Sorry I feel weird posting my exact seat online I‚Äôm paranoid lol)

I‚Äôm in California where event tickets/entertainment is non-taxable so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that‚Ä¶ also when I go to ‚Äúview details‚Äù under the actual ticket on the app it says ‚ÄúTax $0.00‚Äù 

I‚Äôm also not trying to complain because I am ecstatic about my ticket and think the price was well worth it even though it was out of the stated range by $95. I‚Äôm just a math major so the proof of ‚Äúfor all‚Äù statements is something I‚Äôm really passionate about and my exams depend on it. 

I also had VF presale but didn‚Äôt get tickets then because all that was left was either VIP or upper level which I didn‚Äôt want. I obviously couldn‚Äôt see every seat in the stadium but for the seats left when it was my time, they did seem to be all within the range. So it seemed like it was possible dynamic pricing was not used.

When I first heard that song, when it got to that part- I kept taking my head phones out and looking round because I didn‚Äôt get it was part of the song. It‚Äôs so jarring. 

I think it‚Äôs clearer in the remix that‚Äôs she saying now and down but in a weird way/weird effect (as somebody has pointed our above) but I 100% get where you‚Äôre coming from haha",neutral
"I think it‚Äôs that, but also something else at play. 

Taylor talks about when she believes she‚Äôs been taken advantage of, or when she‚Äôs been wronged. Particularly by men, because that‚Äôs who she‚Äôs happened to have relationships with. (Not because of any misandrist tendencies).

I think society often expects women to take abuse from men lying down. When Taylor writes songs about relationships where she‚Äôs been hurt, she validates the feelings of all women who listen to her. 

And there‚Äôs something about a woman being honest to themselves, and not tolerating abuse that I think absolutely terrifies some men. 

I‚Äôm not saying all men are like this, I‚Äôm just not denying the existence of those who are.",sexism

"As someone born in 1989: I didn't get it when I was 28 either. It was there, it was beginning, but it was still background noise. I do think something changes for a lot of women when they turn 30, and with each passing year society starts to question you more and more. I have people assuming I'm an extreme feminist, a lesbian ‚Äì they're trying to figure me out, something's going on, because I'm not married with children and I'm in no rush. People really do have an idea of what a 30 year old woman should be, in my experience even the most progressive people. The guys around me have never been asked the same questions that frequently and intensely. It's just assumed that as a woman, you want those things, it's the goal. I've absolutely had people looking at me like I'm a sad cat lady who's failed at life.

If you don't fit into their idea of a woman in her 30s, they often feel free to ask invasive questions, they ask you why it hasn't happened yet and if you're doing anything about it. It's that bad for someone like me, so I can't imagine what it's like for someone that famous. It's millions of people who have an opinion ‚Äì not everyone voices theirs, but a lot do.

And gosh, personally, I'm uncomfortable with people assuming someone wants to get married and have children even if they once spoken/sung about it. It's just plain weird to comment on it, I think. I would only really ask close friends about it, in a very nuanced way, free of judgement, and it'd be a conversation. This is wanting very personal information about a stranger and voicing your opinion like she's a character in a movie, not a real person.

"I so don‚Äôt want to hear any more about the man this song was (probably) based on. First, because he and Taylor need to be allowed to move on, and I don‚Äôt want to hubris our way into 2016 2.0.

Second, because any real man is the least interesting part of this piece of art. If we spend all of our time discussing two real people we don‚Äôt know, we get caught up in dates, math, and interviews instead of focusing on the art, the way it connects to *us*, makes us feel, and how we interpret it. 

For me, this film combined with especially ATWTMV and I Bet You Think of Me really reframed a lot of things. I pretty deeply relate to feeling really dumb and like you were born in a different world when you are young and some douchebag at uni wants to make himself feel good by making you feel bad, or standing alone at opening or a release party, champagne in hand, wondering why you are ‚Äúalways‚Äù the ‚Äúonly one‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt fit in.

"All I know is that the scammer tried to convince me to use Venmo Purchase Protection and was against using PayPal GS so I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a loophole he would‚Äôve taken advantage of. 

There might be some way to use Venmo Purchase Protection safely but I think the guidelines are not as clear for concert tickets at least and you have to make sure you‚Äôre doing it right. Everyone I‚Äôve seen has said only to use PayPal GS so it must have some risk/loophole involved, especially since the person who scammed me offered to use that instead of PayPal. 

They did not get my TM password. They tricked me into giving them a password reset code after I refused to use Venmo and then they reset it. They called it a Ticketmaster invoice code and said it was a form of protection through Ticketmaster itself. This was of course all bullshit. 

But Ticketmaster‚Äôs website/authentication system is also poorly designed. In order to reset your password, it takes you to a reset page and asks for the code instead of sending you a link that can only be accessed via email associated with the account. Very insecure and a big loophole for scammers to exploit people through phishing.",neutral

"I am going to be causally cruel in the name of being honest and also agree with you that I do feel that Midnights is one of the worst eras in Taylor Swift discography. The songs fall flat, the bonus tracks don't really fit into the Midnight theme and some seem to fit more on Evermore and Folklore than on Midnights, it just too relax. I think Taylor Swift is at a place where she doesn't want to do all of the roll out things she has done for previous eras. I think her new ideas of the present eras are going to be shorter. 

I also agree I feel like Snow on the Beach was a real let down, I would have love to hear Lana have her belt moment and the song is very sleepy. I haven't listened to Midnight since it was released. It's very forgettable, not a lot to remember the tracks are very forgettable and very lack luster.

"**Article text (last third is all Taylor-related)**

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into the owner of Ticketmaster, whose sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets descended into chaos this week, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The investigation is focused on whether Live Nation Entertainment has abused its power over the multibillion-dollar live music industry.That power has been in the spotlight after Ticketmaster‚Äôs systems crashed while Ms. Swift fans were trying to buy tickets in a presale for her upcoming tour, but the investigation predates the botched sale, the people said.Staff members at the agency‚Äôs antitrust division have in recent months contacted music venues and players in the ticket market, asking about Live Nation‚Äôs practices and the wider dynamics of the industry, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is sensitive. The inquiry appears to be broad, looking at whether the company maintains a monopoly over the industry, said one of the people.Live Nation did not immediately comment.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.Officials in the Biden administration have spent the last two years trying to push the boundaries of antitrust law. The Justice Department has mounted several challenges to major mergers, successfully convincing a judge to block Penguin Random House‚Äôs purchase of Simon &amp; Schuster but losing some other cases. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block Meta, Facebook‚Äôs parent company, from acquiring a small virtual reality start-up.The new investigation is the latest scrutiny of Live Nation Entertainment, which is the product of a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster that was approved by the Justice Department in 2010. That created a giant in the live entertainment business that still has no equals in terms of its reach or power.In 2019, its last year of business unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic, Live Nation put on 40,000 events around the world and sold 485 million tickets through Ticketmaster, according to the company‚Äôs annual report. Live Nation is one of the music industry‚Äôs biggest powers in the management of artists, meaning the personal representatives who negotiate business deals on behalf of artists. According its most recent annual report, Live Nation had 100 managers working with more than 450 artists. It does not manage Ms. Swift.When the Justice Department approved the merger ‚Äî over significant opposition from the music industry ‚Äî it required the company to sell some parts of its business. It also reached a legal settlement with the company that forbade Live Nation from threatening concert venues with losing access to its tours if those venues decide to use ticketing providers other than Ticketmaster. Those terms were set to last for 10 years, until 2020.In late 2019, after an¬†investigation, the Justice Department found that Live Nation had repeatedly violated this provision of its decree. It¬†extended¬†the terms of the settlement by five years, to 2025, and adjusted some of the agreement‚Äôs language to clarify what the company was allowed to do when negotiating ticketing deals with venues.Justice Department staff members have asked whether Live Nation was complying with the agreement as part of their new inquiry, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Officials at the agency have grown increasingly wary of such settlements, believing the best way to settle antitrust concerns is through changes to a company‚Äôs structure.The debacle involving Ms. Swift‚Äôs concert tickets this week has exacerbated complaints in the music business and in Washington that Live Nation‚Äôs power has constrained competition and harmed consumers. But it was also an example of extraordinary demand for a highly desired commodity in very limited supply.The problems began Tuesday, when Ticketmaster‚Äôs Verified Fan system, which aims to weed out bots and professional scalpers from the process, began doling out access codes to fans who were interested in buying tickets to Ms. Swift‚Äôs Eras tour that is scheduled to start in March.According to a blog post by Ticketmaster, which was published on Thursday but deleted within hours, 3.5 million fans registered for the program. The company ‚Äúinvited‚Äù 1.5 million of those customers to the presale by sending them codes, and the remaining two million were placed on a waiting list.That day, Ticketmaster received 3.5 billion system requests, causing its app to crash for many users; some who were in the process of buying tickets with their codes were unable to complete their transactions. According to Ticketmaster, two million tickets were sold on Tuesday alone. Another presale, for Capital One cardholders, was held on Wednesday.But Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster canceled its plans for a public ticket sale on Friday, when it would typically sell any tickets remaining after presales. It was unclear how many tickets had already been sold for Ms. Swift‚Äôs tour, and how many ‚Äî if any ‚Äî remained.On Friday, in her first comments about the ticketing debacle, Ms. Swift posted a statement to social media saying she was looking into the situation to see how it could be improved. But she also expressed disappointment in Ticketmaster.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make excuses for anyone,‚Äù Ms. Swift wrote, ‚Äúbecause we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand, and we were assured that they could.‚Äù",neutral

"Okay first initial thoughts after the first play - I also wanna preface this with the fact that folklore/evermore was my peak Taylor and I just love sad songs but I had a feeling she was gonna switch the vibe to a more upbeat sound so I kinda knew it wasn‚Äôt gonna top it for me.

That being said, this definitely gives me more mature 1989 vibes and I think I could end up loving this album a whole lot. I‚Äôll need some replays - like I did with 1989 and rep.

I also think I‚Äôm struggling with the lack of lyric videos, the sound is so poppy sometimes it‚Äôs hard to focus on lyrics and sounds that some of the meaning is getting lost. A solid 8/10 album that I think I‚Äôll grow to love.

Standouts for me are Maroon, Anti-Hero. Karma, The Great War, Question‚Ä¶?, Sweet Nothing, Bigger Than the Whole Sky and of course, Could‚Äôve Would‚Äôve Should‚Äôve.

"i had amazing plans to go to loverfest with my husband and 3 friends, first time i was going to a taylor swift show with other swifites, and we had good seats in the 200s at sofi. i made a whole vacation out of the trip, so i was completely devastated at the postponement and cancellation. seeing that we were supposed to get priority access gave me hope that it wouldn't be difficult to secure seats, and i went into yesterday with plans to buy the max tickets to try and salvage the party that never was. 

4 hours later when i finally got into the arlington show and all that was left with 6 tickets was nosebleeds. i was able to change days from my first option at least, so i got first row of the upper concourse, but still an overall disappointing experience. 

covid had really triggered a lot of anxiety and depression for me, and while i've been working to get myself back in a better spot, something like getting to have that experience again potentially with my friends again was something i was really excited about. by the time i got my tickets i was so stressed and exhausted that i couldn't even be excited. when my husband came in to check on the process, he thought i had not been able to get tickets at all. 

so i mean, at the end of the day i'm incredibly thankful that i was still able to get tickets and at least one of my friends is guaranteed coming, the emotional roller coaster i've been on was so frustrating. i feel so bad for everyone who had to put up with yesterday, and everyone who still has to fight today and friday.",neutral

"Taylor is an artist who moves between genres - and she has been since before Folklore and Evermore even existed. Saying she has always been a pop artist is stupid. 

She started in country music, then moved towards a sort of country/pop hybrid, crossed into more indie/folk music for a little while, then spent some time in pop, Reputation is arguably R&amp;B than anything else, then it was back to pop for lover and then over to folk again for folklore and Evermore, then to electropop for midnights. 

Don't try and diminish her to being an artist who only belongs to one genre. One of the amazing things about her is the way that she moves so well between genres of music, and is able to combine different genres into a cohesive discography.",neutral

"I was imaging very ‚Äúdeep portal, time travel‚Äù as an overall theme/visual.

And Midnights tracks will be peppered through them all. Like we‚Äôll get Folklore/Evermore era, but we‚Äôll get the Great War in there setlist wise. And then finally we‚Äôll go full circle back to Midnights to end it.  There‚Äôs obviously not a lot of time to cover everything so I think a lot of eras will need to be combined sonically/visually and that makes my brain hurt trying to figure out how she will do visuals for it, but I definitely think there will be nods to each eras stage design/costumes/general aesthetic.",neutral

"Everything she describes in Maroon, is seen in the ATW music video. You can even see Sadie and Dylan positioned on the floor with alcohol.

Which links to her Maroon lines:

&gt; How'd we end up on the floor anyway? You say / ""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top ros√©, that's how""

In Everything Has Changed (**this could be just coincidence**) she sings, ‚Äú18 hours ago‚Äù and in the music video both ‚ÄúYoung Ed‚Äù and ‚ÄúYoung Taylor‚Äù are laying while reading The Notebook Efron was cast in TLO another Nicholas S movie, and book.

Theory (ü§°): It is been speculated Zac Efron was the inspiration behind Message in a Bottle alongside Come Back, Be Here. Maybe a coincidence, but Come Back Be Here is the 18th placement track, which is his birthday number, and Taylor tends to pay attention to numerology.

The beginning starting seconds of WANEGBT also references The Last Time where he (Jake) shows up at her door, and Taylor lets him in ‚Äúwearing his best apologies‚Äù / by the end of the music video, she no longer lets him in, because it was ‚Äúthe last time‚Äù especially which was what she asked of him.",neutral

"""Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

I loved this lyric, wish it weren't so relatable! I thought sexy baby was a more commonly known reference to specific beauty standards, how part of society is especially obsessed with a narrow ideal of extreme youth, but also high femme sex appeal, etc. So many parts of mainstream beauty standards are indirectly related to youth, but also parts are indirectly related to youth, keeping women small. God, I would not want to be in the public eye. feeling it as a civilian growing older is enough for me, thanks.

"I will argue that ""The Archer"" is intentional in its lack of build. The production keeps rising slowly toward what we think will be a big emotional climax, in tandem with the increasingly vulnerable disclosures in the lyrics. It pulls back and denies us that climax only in last seconds, as Taylor repeats the lyric ""ready for combat"" (referencing her typical posture of emotional defensiveness). She'd like to be vulnerable and give us a big climactic burst of felling... but she remains afraid to lay down her weapons.

Anyway, these songs... I don't know if it's so artfully intentional.",neutral

"yep! I was a verified fan for loverfest and got tickets in the presale for loverfest west. Yesterday I used my same email affiliated with my loverfest tickets \*and\* I had a boost from Taylor Nation. Yet, when I got in the line, I was in the queue with tens of thousands in front of me for 4.5 hours before I got in. By the time I got into the sale there was hardly anything left (and it was really either floor at $800 or very back rows of the nosebleeds for $160). I still tried to check out on some sort of nosebleeds, but was beaten by a fan for every single one until the show was completely sold out of presale tickets. I literally sat in the sale room in disbelief for 2 hours just hoping and praying new tickets would be added. It seems like the only people who had luck yesterday were those who got in before the code snafu and the line freeze. And, i have honestly heard of very few loverfest people who got in early. But, it might just be confirmation bias and that the only people posting about it are those who are upset, but I still think it's awful that we got nothing for our canceled tickets. UGH. so frustrated and upset. all my friends were counting on me because we thought being a loverfest verified fan who purchased tickets would help me, but it didn't do anything except (maybe) help me get verified again (but I have also heard of loverfest people who were waitlisted, soooooooo)",neutral
"Had loverfest tickets, also got merch. No boosts. I got a ticket thankfully but by the time I got in after waiting hours upon hours I had two options. Spend 109 for a nosebleed or spend 500+ for lower bowl. I love Taylor but I‚Äôm Canadian and I can‚Äôt justify spending that much and traveling for a night.

It felt like maybe since it took so long for me to get in everything decent was gone. Or dynamic pricing was on. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. Wasn‚Äôt there tweets the max ticket would be like mid 400? Not impressed with this tours start. I remember getting rep and lover tickets being a lot smoother and less bullshit than this year.

I genuinely feel bad for the people who had lover tickets and got squat. I‚Äôm surprised I even got something.

One thing to note is that it‚Äôs not over. There‚Äôs another sale coming up for everyone and people will always resell their tickets, sometimes they don‚Äôt scalp hard the regular people. Don‚Äôt lose hope completely

By the way I know people are writing about Lordes message and covid but this was quite the jump in price. I had paid the same amount for these nosebleeds as I did for lower bowl tickets for both rep and lover",neutral

They also added the phone number verification which makes me think bots were out of control yesterday and probably today.

There may not have been ""true"" dynamic pricing but they could certainly change standard seats to VIP in real time to effectively do the same thing.   I could also swear the same seats came up several times.

"1989 is my favorite album. I know a lot of people feel differently because of the lack of country sound and the lack of specificity in the lyrics, but to me, this album is as perfect as it gets. Timeless sound, top-tier lyricism, incredible production: it manages to sound exactly like a Taylor album and totally different at the same time.

‚ÄúBlank Space‚Äù is brilliant: I don‚Äôt think there is a smarter, better written, more self-aware song in her discography. ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù and ‚ÄúWildest Dreams‚Äù are sexy without trying too hard (looking at you, ‚ÄúDress‚Äù). ‚ÄúOut of the Woods‚Äù is achingly beautiful. ‚ÄúShake it Off‚Äù is a catchy without being annoying (looking at you, ‚ÄúMe!‚Äù). ‚ÄúClean‚Äù is transcendent. Even the bonus tracks are incredible: ‚ÄúNew Romantics‚Äù is God-tier Taylor.

This album is a perfect 10/10, the only song that‚Äôs meh for me is ‚ÄúI Wish You Would.‚Äù

I love Bad Blood and never understand the Swiftie hate for it. (I don't exactly consider myself a Swiftie but might be delusional at this point).

It's fun, empowering and assertive, even aggressive. It can help a person find strength against an adversary, imagined or not. If you're a people-pleasing truster, as Swift has proven herself to be, this kind of song can protect you a little. At least in theory. It reminds you not to let everyone in.

Even then I slept on her. My wife would play songs from Folklore and Evermore on our Alexa Dots and I enjoyed them, but I still slept. When Midnights came out I had just subscribed to Apple Music, so I had all the songs available to me and decided to check it out. I quickly became obsessed with TGW and WCS, and that was the tipping point. I‚Äôm obsessed (in a good way, lol) now, and I‚Äôve found so many songs I never even know about. About 98% of my music playing for the month has been TS. I‚Äôve quickly discovered that no musician I‚Äôve ever liked has even close to the amount of songs I like than TS does.

&gt;	Millionaires and corporations are not our friends 

I know. I mean, that‚Äôs exactly my point. That sucks. They suck. They should do better. We should hold them accountable.

I know the solution is to not buy. I also don‚Äôt buy. The solution is also to not produce the crap in the first place. 

&gt;	Consume less

Which, again, is one of the elements I was arguing for. 

&gt;	consume more mindfully 

Such as not buying shitty merch?

&gt;	get angry with the big things themselves

Such as one of the most powerful musical artists and one of the most powerful entertainment corporations having shitty business practices? 

&gt;	advocate for solutions through productive avenues.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs a productive avenue for you. I do think that having conversations like these can move the needle. I think being critical for the kind of consumption the persons or corporations we associate with ‚Äúmorally good‚Äù is important, and I think it helps humanity as a whole becoming more aware. Much like conversations on greenwashing. I don‚Äôt think that I am some climate activist for commenting on the Taylor Swift-sub, but I think it‚Äôs a dangerous and quite frankly senseless sentiment that unless you visibly change the world (whether for better or for worse), your actions don‚Äôt matter. 

Ultimately, people will feel whatever they feel, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with feeling outrage or anger over another corporation and their very, very famous face having shitty business practices. Others being worse, doesn‚Äôt change that.",neutral

Very few songs on this album feel like my ""midnight"" moments - good or bad. For others, it resonates more. 

Taylor has talked about how women are expected to constantly reinvent themselves as artists. And she's done that so beautifully and so consistently that when this new album wasn't a reinvention, it didn't pack the same punch. Evermore was marketed at Folklore 2.0. Midnights was set up as a stand alone alum. ""Weak"" for Taylor is still miles ahead of where most artists normally stand.

The way it turned out for me is that my mom and I are now much closer than when I was a teenager, and I think the therapy was a big help in getting there. Our relationship is much stronger than it might have been otherwise. Therapy helped drain away the bitterness and resentment I had from my childhood.

"I think she was always going heavily pop within the country genre and likely would have continued that way. Speak Now was really a pop album with a slightly twangy voice and Mean. Red actually had a little more country flavour than SN in some songs but also had songs that were way more straightforward pop than anything she‚Äôd done. So I think I can picture a Taylor that would have gone down the route of continuing to explore with genre fusion and making more pop sounds but with mostly live instruments. I can even see a Taylor that would do full synth pop songs on the same album as ostensibly more country songs possibly.

I think when I look at it from an album to album perspective:

Debut foreshadowed pop country in Fearless.

Fearless foreshadowed pop rock in SN.

SN foreshadowed more adult pop/contemporary pop sounds in Red.

Red could have foreshadowed so many things. In this case, it foreshadowed more capital P Pop  but the same album could have foreshadowed folkier or alternative sounds, a return to slightly more country songs, upbeat instrumentation based pop like Stay Stay Stay and Starlight‚Ä¶it was all there.

It‚Äôs interesting because the genre of modern country has expanded so much (and debatably become very watered down definition wise) so much so that I think a lot of SN and Red stuff that were straight pop then could pass for country now so I wonder if the same sonic cohesion and need to stick to one genre pressures would have existed for her if she released those albums in the country genre now. Ironically 22 and Never Ever that seemed like radical genre shifts to pop for her back then would now fit in with a lot of country radio songs with no disruption.",neutral

"These are all off the top of my head and might not work but maybe one will spark for ya!

*Taylor Swift Bingo (since she did the bingo ball thing for her announcements). Everyone fills out a bingo card with Taylor songs, put her catalogue on shuffle and first to five in a row wins! You could always have this going on in the background while you‚Äôre doing other stuff 

*The Picture Game, T-Swift Edition. If youve never played the picture game, you cut up a bunch of paper into squares (4‚Äùx4‚Äù or so). Then you give everyone a stack equal to the number of people. 6 people, each person gets 6 squares. Then Round 1, everyone writes a word or phrase. Then everyone passes the stack to the right. You read the word on your stack, put it on the bottom, then DRAW a picture of it. Then everyone passes to the right. Now you put the picture on the bottom and write what you think the picture was. Alternate between picture and word until you complete the stack. By the time it makes it back to the original owner, you can get some very funny interpretations. T-swift edition just means your word has to do with Taylor. So it might got something like Scarf-&gt; someone thinks it looks like a snake -&gt; reputation etc etc. This is a great icebreaker.

*Taylor Swift Sporcle Quizzes. They have millions, everything from naming songs to general trivia. You could do it as a group or do it VS to see who the biggest swiftie is (I‚Äôd avoid this if anyone is overly competitive lol)

*Write your own Taylor song. The catch is you can only do a word at a time and then someone else has to jump in. I‚Äôm sure by the end you‚Äôll have a mishmash of references to the middle of the night and rain!!

*T-swift through the years. Just watch music videos sequentially and provide commentary so you can see how our lil blonde genius has grown over time! 

*Have everyone say their favorite Taylor song and make sure you listen to all those!

*Contest for best 1989 catwalk strut from her tour! Can also do contest for best shocked awards acceptance or best awkward awards show dancing!!

YOYOK always struck me less as a ""you're alone, kid"" but more ""you're of your own caliber, kid."" Some people you meet just create their own category and redefine the possibility of what love can be.

"So, I think Taylor Swift has taught me I hate cohesion. I‚Äôm a music jumbler, I rareeely listen to albums as a whole. Rather I like to make playlists of certain songs I‚Äôm feeling at the moment, they usually end up being a massive playlist that weirdly define my life at the time (for example when I moved to Florida I impulsively made a playlist FLO RIDA, and that became the songs I listened to most for that first year). I sprinkle her songs throughout all these playlists. Usually I end up putting songs I haven‚Äôt appreciated in a while, which leads to a inevitable cycle. I‚Äôll have Fearless thrown in next to Gavin DeGraw which is next to Paramore and then ends with some Bodak Yellow. 

Maybe this all roots back to never having a car with a CD player in it, so full albums were never my thing. Or maybe back to my massive song impatience/hyperactivity and my dad not allowing me to touch the radio in the car because I would, without fail, change the song halfway through (sorry but what if there‚Äôs a better song on another station?!). 

Who knows. All I know is that I think her most cohesive album is 1989 and it is also my least favorite album of hers. I think cohesion a lot of the times means things sound the same/along similar lines and then they all begin mashing together in my head. So I love Red and Speak Now and Lover for their craziness.

"The baby is Blake Lively's kid who had just learned the word at the time, so I think it's a cute way to show how the song title was inspired. 

The song is peak messy drunk girl, she's lovestruck but all over the place, just as she was in that early 2016 stage where she was floating between Calvin, Tom and Joe. It's not really meant to be coherent or clever or sharp, it's just messy vulnerability when the timing is all off and you know things could be better but they're just...not. Yet. But could they be? He did touch her hand in that dark room after all.

Yay for The Civil Wars (briefly) reuniting for 'Safe &amp; Sound'! I knew Taylor had the power!

"I always tell people that the difference between what is going on right now in the fandom compared to 3 years ago is that we actually KNOW that stuff is coming. 2-3 years ago we just knew that Taylor typically had a 2 year album cycle and so we just lived with that. But now we know she is re-recording all of her music so we know that 4 albums are coming‚Ä¶ which then gets us more riled up because we‚Äôre like ‚Äúwell when are they coming??‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we going to be in a re-recording era for 3 years for music we‚Äôve mostly heard before except for the vault tracks?‚Äù.

"I could agree with Bad Blood, but why do you think that WANEGBT is weak? It is her 6th more successful song in the US, after the 5 diamond songs, it is her biggest song in Japan and SK. Indeed it is the best selling western song in 10s decade in Japan, one of the few western songs that have sold more than 1 M of digital copies. It is also her 4th most sold worldwide song in digital sales (the main format of when was released) after LS, SIO and IKYWT. Maybe you think that due to TV version streams, but if you add the 2012 version and TV of all songs it is still one of the most streamed songs daily. Also WANEGB is gaining more daily views than any other red (2012) videos and definetly is bigger in Europe than You Belong with me. Also after red tour Taylor has performed in 1989 and Rep tour, it is true that in Rep was in a medley but IKYWT wasn‚Äôt perform at all. I think is one of the most know songs of her.

The thing is, I'm not angry with them, just because they regularly send emails updating us with what is going on (lack of material, sold way more then expected, covid relates stuff delays the material to get to Brazil, etc.)...

"I can understand wanting to wait til the show to see everything, but what I don‚Äôt understand is the surprise when seeing content on socials. It‚Äôs not fair to ask millions of other people not to share their experiences, or to hide them behind a blurred warning when so many fewer people do not want to see the content. If it‚Äôs not healthy or positive for your mindset, stay off social media and avoid reading news articles abt the tour. At most, you‚Äôll see a picture of one costume at the top of an article about the tour, but you don‚Äôt have to go any further into it.

"1.  Just between us did the love affair maim you too?  This one line shows the narrator‚Äôs vulnerability and insecurity and just wants to know if she meant anything to him at all.  Do you have a scar from this, just between us, no one else has to know, did this mean anything?  
2.  Age difference.  Many relationships have a significant age difference that are healthy.  In this story, the age difference equates to a maturity difference and a difference in power in the relationship. It‚Äôs easier to manipulate a young 20 year old who hadn‚Äôt even moved out of her parent‚Äôs house yet, than it is a 31 yr old woman (or man, doesn‚Äôt matter) that has learned from her 20‚Äôs and gained experience in life and in relationships.  A 20-yr old living with their parents does not have the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù to be in a physical relationship with a 30 yr old man. 
3.  It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything to me but I do think it‚Äôs her best and I suppose that means something.
4.  I prefer the 10-minute version because it is supposed to be the original lyrics, you  get more of the story.  And more of the heartbreak. 
5.  I don‚Äôt know much about songwriting techniques.   Her storytelling, you can picture the scene taking place.  Vividly.  Her ability to write very clearly and paint a picture of a scene is unmatched currently.  
6.  Depends on which I heard first.  I think if the alternate POV was now written, I‚Äôm not sure people would really like it as much because they are so attached to this story.  Because Taylor has painted this picture in their minds for a decade.  If she had a track on the original RED album that told the story from the alternate perspective that would be very different.  But it‚Äôs a decade old song and it would be very difficult at this point to change minds. And it might even have a negative reaction. 
7.  The kitchen scene was powerful. Superbly acted and directed.  The gaslighting.  The age difference and this the manipulation /gaslighting of the young girl.  Her feelings were valid yet dismissed and she was told that she was wrong, it was her, it was her fault because she had been quiet and weird, selfish, etc.   everyone has a right to respond to behavior, it‚Äôs valid and should be heard.  The apology, some people say great he‚Äôs apologizing, but don‚Äôt get it. He‚Äôs apologizing for something he has made her believe was in her head, and it‚Äôs an insincere apology; the behavior will continue, it‚Äôs a cycle of behavior of gaslighting and manipulating this young girl over and over.  It‚Äôs a powerful scene because you know it‚Äôs not the last time that is going to happen and it probably wasn‚Äôt the first time either.  One scene tells you everything you need to know and it‚Äôs powerful and emotional.  Very well done.",neutral
"Honestly, based on some of her interviews this weekend, it's pretty clear she was saving some of these songs for her next album before she knew she was going to go full pop.

She knows that if she says something, the fans listen (exhibit A: the entire Scooter/Scott debacle, exhibit B: calling out the joke on that Netflix show). Saying ""stop"" would be entirely within her power, AND would likely stop the vast majority of it, or at least get people to tone things down.

"This is gonna be a long one...

Don't think the sound is as polished but I love that about music. Makes it feel more authentic. How emotions and thoughts are chaotic when you broke up with someone important. The beat was a bit jarring the first listen because of how used to I am with the original but after a few more, the lyrics stood out more. 

New lyrics here we go..

""Fuck the patriarchy"" - was a no to me so after hearing it, I feared I will hate it. 

""And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now. He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was"" - how heartbreaking, how I also felt shame for expecting a man to feel the same way I feel for them, being all excited about it while the rest of the world and wiser me see how silly I was.

""'Til we were dead and gone and buried. Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same. After three months in the grave..."" - I interpreted it as them hooking up after breaking up and her feeling shame for letting herself do so. 

""You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath"" - Need I say moreeeeeeee????? How is this so beautiful???

""Sacred prayer, and we'd swear. To remember it all too well, yeah"" - I love these about relationships. A promise to remember the small moments in our life together.""

""They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell."" - perfect rhyme aghhhhhhh and prequel to ""Lover""

""Every time you double cross my mind"" - cliche if left without the ""double"" so I loved that it added a new layer

""You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine. And that made me want to die"" - was too casually mentioned like a friend telling you a story about her ex. I couldn't take it seriously because of how overused the last phrase it in real life. :D

""The idea you had of me, who was she?"" - don't we all have this question in relationships? So mf beautiful!!!!!!  
""A never needing ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you"" - Damn Jake

""Not weeping in a party bathroom. Some actress asking me what happened"" - Moment I knew

""you, that's what happened, you"" - will think about these the next few days, and some more in the years to come

""You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes. Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show"" - I love TS for her descriptive lyrics for characters and places, creates vivid poetry for me! 

""But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come. And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"" - it was heartbreaking knowing she waited for a guy while her dad was with her on her 21st birthday. A well-deserved 22 for her! I'm crying!!!

""And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes"" - Jake really made her think she was unfunny. What a prick.

""I'll get older but your lovers stay my age"" - ooff

""From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones.I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight"" - going to see her Red album era and damn girl that's why she was so skinny and sick-looking then, I thought it was just an aesthetic. 

""Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?  
Cause in this city's barren cold, I still remember the first fall of snow  
And how it glistened as it fell, I remember it all too well"" - perfect ending

Outro - I changed my mind. This is the perfect ending. The fading vocals describe the emotions of a breakup, reminiscing the small moments and just hoping it somehow affected the other person like it did you. Ugghh I'm not crying, I'm not crying, I'm not crying.

Anyway, I love this song and TS lyrical genius.",neutral

I was a John Mayer fan first, he was my first concert when I was 15 and I‚Äôve seen him live 20-21 times since. Absolutely love his music. I remember when the relationship or whatever the thing with Taylor was happened. I was disappointed in a lot of things he said in the media around that time. However‚Ä¶he is now in his 40s and has clearly done a LOT of growing up (evident in the songs he‚Äôs written and lack of crazy tabloid coverage). 

I‚Äôve been a Taylor fan for like 7-8 years and absolutely love her music. I wanted to go to the Eras tour so bad to see her live for the first time. I love WCS and think it‚Äôs a great song about her revisiting a time in her life- that was years ago. When it comes down to it, none of us know exactly what happened between them therefore no one should be out there bullying him, artists associated with him, or any of her other exes. Taylor has always had a relationship with her fans- if she would say something to Swifties directly, maybe (maybe) they would be nice and stop trying to fight battles that don‚Äôt need to be fought for her?",neutral

ATW is a great song. I love it. But the music video does absolutely nothing to make me think it would deserve an accolade outside of ""oh. I mean yeah it was fine""

"I feel like the point of New Year's Day is that it's so contrasting from the album. The album starts off with themes of taking back her reputation and revenge, but as it progresses, the narrative shifts to her finding love and someone who didn't care about her reputation, who's stayed by her side even almost 7 years later. To have an acoustic song on reputation shows that Taylor has some content with where she is and finding bliss and happiness amidst the drama. It leaves the listener with this sense of hope and calm after such an intense album. Personally I think New Year's Day fits really well as reputation's closer. The production is so different, but it's still perfect for it.  I may also be a bit biased because reputation is my favorite Taylor album.",neutral

"SOOOO I was originally going to post this but the post didnt seem to go through so im gonna comment it, idk if its too long for a comment lmao but i'll try. I'm sure everyone has their thoughts, both realistic and in a perfect world, of what the concerts are going to look like. So, in my fixated anticipatory spiral of excitement over the tour tomorrow, I decided to make a setlist prediction. 


I should note that I have never been to a Taylor Concert, only been to 1 concert ever and that was MUCH smaller and many years back. So I don't expect this to be super accurate. It's probably too long, too, lmao. I tried to keep it relatively realistic with a little bit of dreams sprinkled here and there. I didn't want to just do a setlist, though, I wanna do the transitions and little details. So, in my eyes, this is how I imagine it would go down.


FINAL SETLIST PREDICTION:


#1. Lavender Haze/ ITHK/ Willow
I imagine this would start with a dark stadium. The lights all off, and a slow, almost foreboding synth builds up until it comes to screeching halt. And four words echo through the stadium: ""Meet me at midnight."" All of a sudden the beat drops and the intro music to Lavender Haze starts. Little white lights like stars appear everywhere, and finally, we see her, in a sparkly Lavender look. She does the first verse of not Lavender Haze, but WILLOW. The prechorus introduces Lavender Haze, and as the chorus comes in, so does actual Lavender Haze. Then, the 2nd verse switches to I Think He Knows, and the rest swaps back and forth between the three.


#2. Tim McGraw 
I imagine that after the mash up, she stops to talk for a bit. ""It's me, hi. Thanks for choosing to spend your evening with me, it means so much...."" etc... lol. She talks about her journey of having to cancel loverfest, the quarantine albums, and revisiting all her old albums via re-recording, consequently paving the way for Midnights. How its crazy how much things have changed, and now, she wants to take us on a journey from start to finish. Cue her first song on her first album, Tim McFuckingGraw.


#3. COUNTRY OUR SONG MASHUP
I imagine after performing Tim McGraw she talks briefly about her country roots and how important they are to her. She says ""I love music, it's my life. So throughout my life, I've heard every album, listened to the radio, waiting for something to come along... that's as good as Our Song ;)"" Then she quickly jumps into a total yeehaw Taylor gown and preforms a Mashup between Our Song and any of the following: Love Story, You Belong With Me, Mr. Perfectly Fine, Mean, and/or IBYTAM. Probably 2-4 of these make it.


#4. Enchanted/Wildest Dreams
I imagine this would lead her to talk about love, her journey evolving through love. How some were ""perfectly fine"", while others were utterly enchanting. And sometimes, time doesnt matter when the clock strikes just right, and you meet someone once in a once in a lifetime way, who'll leave you wondering forevermore. This starts the infamous Enchanted/Wildest Dreams Mashup. I wanna hear it differently, I'd love to hear the Enchanted verses paired with the Wildest Dream chorus thoughhh ugh taylor please üò≠ I guess that'll have to stay in my Wildest Dreams, ahh, ahh.


#5. All Too Well
Fittingly track 5 on the setlist, I imagine this would leave her talking about when beautiful things wilt away, Yada yada. I'm writing too much. She credits the fans and their love, and one of their many, many anthems. She does an outfit change, not sure what, some sort of youthful looking dress I guess, but then she begins singing All Too Well; I'm just unsure if she would do the 5 minute one or the 10 minute. Either way, little leaves fall across the stage, as wind whips her hair around. 


#6. Dear John/ Would've Could've Should've 
I imagine this would lead her to talk about the more forgotten moments by the world, the ones forgotten by everyone but the one who experienced it. She'd talk briefly about a random struggle from her life, maybe her young self's lonliness, and how she could have the whole world cheering her on, but she still felt so alone at times. She just needed someone, someone to take her away. And maybe that adventure had been overshadowed, but today, the girl in the dress will sing you a song. She sings a Mashup of the two, honestly not sure how it would go but I just really wanna know lol.


#7. State of Grace/ IKYWT/ Style
I imagine this would be where she lightens the mood back up, maybe decides to dedicate IKYWT to one of her cats or something lmao. She changes again into a RED style look, Talks about the RED era with nostalgia, says a little something and then moves on to preform 3 of her best songs of all time, mixed together ;) Starting with the 2 red songs, I can imagine a lot of red themes on the stage, not sure what it would look like, maybe something with mosaic broken hearts?!?!? Then out of nowhere she switches outfits AGAIN and starts style.


#8. ROTATING SONG 
I imagine this is where the rotating song will come in. Well honestly I don't really know, I think it may be placed differently depending on the location. Like for me since I'll be going to the Metlife concert, it'll probably be Nothing New with Phoebe Bridgers there, maybe mashed with The Lucky One or one of Bridgers songs. For people with Haim probably No Body No Crime/Gasoline, others it'll just be a random less popular song of hers lol. Very curious to see what she'll play.


#9. Blank Space
I imagine this would be where she starts to talk about her reputation, and how even before rep, she had addressed it many times. Maybe at some point she does something like she dissapears for a minute, leaving everyone in suspense with kinda just nothing around. Then she comes back, no noticeable changes, and just goes ""Oops, sorry about that, seems I left you with a little bit of a blank space...."" Cue the mashup, a switch to an 89 outfit, and a flashy, fun sequence.


#10. Out Of The Woods/ Question...?
I imagine this leads her to talk about her career blowing up, the difficulties surrounding that. Maybe she gets a bit vulnerable with the audience and talks about how her fame was a double edged sword and she could only find validation or any sort of opinions from others rather than within. Everything was a struggle, and in every good moment, instewd of being able to enjoy them, she was foreboding the ending, with one question...: ""are we out of the woods yet?"" The intro music. Some sort of vines or trees sprout from the stage. Dancers. Then, that ""I remember"" echoes, and then the first verse of Question...? Then she sings ""can I ask u a question: are we out of the woods yet..."" and the chorus and second verse plays, then the bridge, final chorus of question, finally, the extended tour outro of OOTW.


#11. VENGEFUL KARMA MASHUP
I imagine this would lead her to talk about how the anxiety took over, she thought it won... she dissapears for a minute, then she says ""but I came back with a vengeance, cause you know what? Karma is a God."" She pops up in a super REP style black outfit. Then she proceeds to Mashup any of the following rep songs: ...Ready For It? I Did Something Bad, Don't Blame Me, LWYMMD, and/or TIWWCHNT with Karma, and possibly Vigilante Shit as well.

"reputation is in my top 3 albums, along with Red TV and 1989. I think of it as more of an empowering album. Songs like Look What You Made Me Do aren't meant to be one of the best songs she's ever made. The reason it's a great single is because it's catchy and easy to sing to, which will make it easier to get stuck in people's heads and therefore peak their interest in the album. That's also why ...Ready For It? is a great second single.

I also agree with a lot of the other comments about this album being a concept of coming back stronger than ever while also finding love in the process. It's this desire for vengeance but also being vulnerable and finding who I like to believe is her soulmate, Joe. Finding love in the midst of your reputation seemingly hitting rock bottom is something I relate to all too well, as it sums up my first three semesters of college. In the midst of rumors and things I've said that I regret, I decided to isolate myself in my dorm room whenever I wasn't going to class or getting food. I lost a lot of people's respect and was seen as an asshole and a narcissist, when in fact, my humor was meant to make fun of narcissists, but I guess it rubbed people the wrong way. It was never my intention to hurt anyone, and I genuinely thought people understood my humor. Getting back to my point, I confided in my then best friend, who is now my boyfriend. This is one of the many reasons why I dedicate the SNL version of Call It What You Want to him, as he's not exactly a fan of the trap beat on the album version.

...Ready For It? is my go to empowering song, this idea that these people who've underestimated me, ostracized me, and didn't take the time to get to know me will have no idea what hit them. It's also a fantastic opener, further evident by the reputation  Stadium Tour. The best revenge is not letting your reputation define you. To say ""Fuck what they think! I have people in my life who care about me, who value me as a person, and want to be around me. I have people who like me for me."" I found those people this past semester, and it feels like things are looking up for me. Reputation has helped me find my way as a person and empower me to come back better, improve myself, acknowledge my mistakes so I don't make them again, and not let toxic people define me. I've found a man who, if I threw a new year's party, would help me clean up the morning after and take care of me if I got super high and was feeling like shit, or I'd be the one taking care of him if he got drunk and was super hungover. We've been there for each other through thick and thin this last year, and my side of the story can be summarized through reputation.

On that note, New Year's Day makes a fantastic closer because it's so stripped down and it remarks that coming back stronger than before doesn't mean complete revenge and vigilante shit; it can also mean being vulnerable with your past and recognizing who knows and likes you for you and will stay by your side no matter what others think.

Also, if we're gonna be real here, reputation is a fantastic album to work out to. Every single song except for New Year's Day is extremely upbeat and I never skip a song.",neutral

"I don‚Äôt think her calling herself a monster is entirely about looks either though.

‚ÄúA sexy baby‚Äù, is probably both a pretty girl but a baby is a small. When I think of a sexy baby it seems like someone young and dainty.

She says she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo big to hang‚Äù and this REALLY makes me think of how Lorde said the following about hanging out with Taylor: ""It‚Äôs like having a friend with very specific allergies,"" Lorde began, clearly not about to hold anything back. ""There are certain places you can‚Äôt go together. Certain things you can‚Äôt do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship.""

I believe a monster lurching toward your city is talking about how she has to make all these security arrangements and hide. She can‚Äôt just be a normal woman who can be flirtatious and carefree because of the paparazzi and also just even her safety.

Nothing you are saying is new though. I have been to every Taylor tour multiple times and every video I have there are people singing and talking over her this tour I probably can hear the best I've ever been able to in my videos. Yes some people can be loud and annoying but it is very rare for someone to be like that the entire show and I think you're jumping to conclusions based on some short tiktoks. Also the sitting thing is ridiculous literally every pop concert I've been to in over a decade everyone has stood for most of the show especially Taylor Swift shows (I'm usually lower bowl or floor but for Taylor I know people stand in the nosebleeds too).

"First thoughts!  
\- Keeping count - ""but baby who's counting.. 123!"" (so it goes!)  
\- The verse certainly reminds me of a song, but I don't know what it is yet in terms of how it sounds --- maybe a bit ""It's Nice to Have a Friend""??  
\- ""You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love- the slowest way is never loving them enough"" - what a lyric  
\- Verse 2 calls back to Ivy in a way, regarding ""good husband"" and possibly not wanting to get married... also reminds me of Speak Now, though that's just the wedding imagery I think   
\- I wonder if this is one of those non-autobiographical songs; though to be fair, she's now sung a fair bit about infidelity and cheating (Illicit affairs, august, betty, no body no crime, ivy); so perhaps she really did cheat on Calvin or Tom?

I like my original mishearing better tbh - I know that that is the moment that things are supposed to turn around, but I like it better having that be the point where the narrator finally crosses her own line - the other person is metaphorically down, looking up at her, vulnerable, but she attacks anyway. And then immediately regrets it as she comes to terms with the fact that this must be it, she‚Äôs lost this person forever. 

It makes the next verse more meaningful and bittersweet I think - where she says there was not morning glory, it was war it wasn‚Äôt fair - because she *didn‚Äôt* hold back in that crucial moment so even though they are rebuilding now towards peace (!), that doesn‚Äôt make what happened justified and her own actions are a burden she has to live with.",neutral

"If you are a software engineer, you have to realize that the more you simplify the website the less opportunity there is to catch bots. I am very familiar with the technology behind their platform and I can confirm every viable suggestion that you have is already in place. If you want to see for yourself, go take a look at the hundreds of requests and all of the profiling that they do when you visit a page with an interactive map. They take over 100 different inputs to decide whether a user is a bot or not. They are obviously considering checkout time as an input already, this is one of the most obvious ones. You can't honestly expect that you, as someone who's probably used the website a few times, has better input than their extremely experienced team of developers, some of which have been working there for over a decade. Not trying to be rude, but this post is laughable.

The conclusion you should arrive at here is that bot prevention is already done to its maximum, and as a ticket broker I can confirm that almost no one in the industry uses bots. Ticketmaster implements Distil by Imperva, which is very advanced and logs everything. It almost guarantees you will get caught long term. It's also cost efficient to just use actual humans to purchase tickets, all of whom are better at it than your average fan because they do it for a living, and last of all it's simply not worth the legal troubles.

Not even trying to defend Ticketmaster, they're a garbage company with no morals and they screw over the fan in almost every case, but this is not one of them. Bots have not been a major problem in the industry for a very long time.",neutral

"I‚Äôm so sorry that the whole thing has blown up to such an extent. I think it‚Äôs a shame because two things are true:-
1. She did a fantastic job at recovering from the previous cancelled party and cultivating an image of someone who was all about her music and healing. She‚Äôs had massive critical and commercial success the last two years and she should be allowed to call out shitty, sexist behaviour she fought so long against.

2. She is a major global superstar and unfortunately some of her many fans are zealots and try and fight her battles for her. Some are using this as an excuse to justify online bullying. 

So whilst I get that she tweeted it as per point 1, point 2 is still valid and it‚Äôs this point that has caused a massive issue. 

Therefore she does need to issue a statement clarifying that this was never her intention. We know this but now is the time to do something about it to stop it in its tracks. Whilst she‚Äôs not responsible for the behaviour of these people she needs to distance herself from their actions ASAP.

The only thing that would stress me out would be if she doesn‚Äôt do something like that. This has turned into a PR nightmare that she (nor the actors targeted) are deserving of. However she does now need to clarify her statement. Silence is not a good look. She doesn‚Äôt need to apologise or retract but unfortunately the tweet has spiralled into a mega storm and the longer she waits the more it‚Äôll look like she stays silent when things turn ugly. That‚Äôs not who she is or wants to be so actions are needed.",neutral

That being said: I'm pretty sure she only released it because of how popular the leak was. We got Need and other songs, but none of them smashed like AOTG, so that's why she rushed released that song to capitalize on the trend just like she did with WDTV.

"Well, investigate where the info came from. If it was reported in a reputable outlet such as Variety or The Hollywood Reporter, then it is almost certainly true. (Very rarely are they wrong, but when they are, they correct themselves.)

There are a few credible leakers who have a reputation for giving out accurate info and specific details (for example, Mr. S on ATRL who often hears music before it's released). 
That's the kind of thing you can learn to recognize by paying attention to the source and how often they give out accurate, specific info. None of the random twitter accounts with ""leak"" in their name are ever credible. They tweet vague statements and predictions anyone can make and occasionally they turn out to be right by pure chance.

In the case of The National album tracklist, it was first posted on their subreddit and the person included a link to the Amazon page where they saw the tracklist. So people who visited the website before the error was fixed could see the tracklist themselves. Info like that being uploaded on Amazon means it is most likely correct- and we now have confirmation that the tracklist is real.

It's just like learning how to recognize whether any information you see on the internet is trustworthy. People post random things on Facebook and Twitter all the time; that doesn't just apply to Taylor news/rumors.  Ask yourself, where did this information originally come from? Can I verify it myself? If not, does the person who first posted it have a reputation for providing accurate info?",neutral

"Reputation was my first album rollout experience. I started following it after the LWYMMD video came out. That era rollout was perfect.

Ugh, so perfect. Edit: Also getting to go to Rep tour two nights in a row was also great! It's my favourite concert experience I've had. 

I was annoyed during Lover's rollout. The easter eggs were too much. I also wasn't a huge fan of Me or YNTCD. But I really enjoyed the actual album.

Folklore and Evermore drops were such exciting days. I was working from home, and just freaking out the whole day. It felt so cozy during the pandemic.

I don't remember much about Fearless TV, other than thinking ""omg she's actually starting the rerecords!"" and the dating site commercial Ryan Reynolds did using Love Story TV and having it in repeat lol.

Red TV was exciting too! I finally had a swiftie friend and we planned out a whole day on the day it released. I bought us the Starbucks Taylor drinks, we bought dinner, and then we watched the All Too Well video, and watched the lyric videos and analyzed the lyrics to the vault songs!

It's only been during the last few weeks that I've been combing through her discography, listening to each album one by one and in the process finding lots of songs that resonate with me and which I really like. My appreciation for her songwriting has grown by leaps and bounds.

Yes I think you‚Äôre absolutely right and I see what you mean now. I previously had the date of Gigi‚Äôs party incorrect (which was the 28th) which is my mistake, I apologize. I went through and struck any misinformation on that from my other posts only because I didn‚Äôt want to spam the feed with corrections, but it‚Äôs entirely understandable if you did not see them. But your clarification changes the circumstances of what (more than probably) happened.

While I stand by the *possibility* that Calvin would want Taylor to maintain her network so he could take advantage of the connections, it is also not a big stretch at all to guess that he was controlling and threw fits about her going out (especially without him) as you‚Äôve suggested. It‚Äôs classic controlling behavior, and so is revealing deeply personal or deeply important information about a person and their life and livelihood when they aren‚Äôt there to give their input. 

In fact, would it be too far fetched to presume that he said such things about Taylor on Seacrest as a form of public humiliation **because** she went out the night before ‚ÄúWiThOuT His PeRmiSsiOn‚Äù and it made him mad so he was ‚Äúteaching her a lesson‚Äù? God, the more we investigate this guy the more sickening I find him. I had an ex like that who, for 8 years treated me well, never tried to control me, but I was also in college. The second I got a job out of college, he changed ENTIRELY and he *attempted* to tell me I can‚Äôt go anywhere without him unless I called to check in and ask person. üòëbitch please. When I immediately threw that ridiculous demand right in the trash, he resorted to calling me a sl*t and wh*re and other vile names simply because my workplace had men who worked there. 

ANYWAY, my point is that there are many men who take interest in the trophy that you are and use you as a beautiful accessory. But the moment you start doing what you want to do (Midnight Rain could also fit in here as a Calvin song? Maybe? ü§î), they lose their MINDS because they feel threatened and terrified of losing the upper hand in the relationship. Calvin‚Äôs first mistake was believing he ever had the upper hand at all. 

So, to your theory and taking into account my errors, I think you are right that the fight they likely had was Taylor arguing that he disrespected her by speaking for her, and he probably snapped back with some toxic ass shit like ‚Äúwell what about you? Going around town and partying all the time.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt confirmed by it doesn‚Äôt take much to fill in those blanks with the info we do have. Plus, it‚Äôs an amazingly ordinary situation that happens to involve two extraordinary people, but I think many of us have experience enough to make educated guesses.

ANYWAY, all this to say you were right and I got my timeline mixed up. But I think we can all agree that Calvin did not treat Taylor well, at least at the end, and I‚Äôm just so glad she had the fortitude to draw a hard line.

(Hope this makes sense! It‚Äôs late and I am sick so my thoughts probably seem all over the place lol.) But I am having a ton of fun discussing and theorizing this kind of thing! I think it‚Äôs so interesting to trade ideas because there is always something I missed, or would‚Äôve NEVER even thought of on my own without talking to you guys.",neutral
"It‚Äôs weird to me that people are accusing her of cheating or using her fame to get in with the top directors.

That is literally what people do to get into Hollywood. You don‚Äôt just become a famous director, writer, or actor by submitting an application for employment and hoping for the best. You actually have to know the right people to get the opportunities you want. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs why she starred in Amsterdam.",neutral

"I don't like this album. 

 I always find synth and vocal distortions grating in music, and that's especially true on this album. (I struggled with ""Reputation"" for similar reasons.) And I'm realizing that maybe I'll never be able to enjoy Taylor again because of Jack's production style. Truly, I have such adverse sensory experiences to a lot of the repetitive sounds on a lot of her post-1989 work. 
 :( 

I miss the ""singability"" of earlier eras. I miss melodies like, ""You say you're fine, I know you better than that."" from YBWM, or anything from the ""Red"" album. On so many of these new songs, Taylor seems to be singing the same note over and over again. It's almost chant-like, on some songs, and I find that to be really annoying / grating. 

I miss the Pop sounds of Cruel Summer, Blank Space,  etc. and I miss the guitar strums on Last Kiss. 

I think the 7 tracks of the 3am version are the best tracks on the whole thing. 

Thanks for making this post.",neutral

"Yes i totally agree with you. 
Imo many people love folklore &amp; evermore for the poetic lyrics. But the thing is, she was always a phenomenal songwriter and many people can't see past the pop to actually *hear* it. Her lyrics always were poetic, few songwriters can do what she does. And she did it long before folklore &amp; evermore, but people didn't  / couldn't see her as the poet that she is because she is a not only a pop artist, but a HUGE one. And for many people pop isn't that genre that can be poetic. 
I often say to my non swiftie friends that taylor is one of the most underrated artists. Few people see her for the genius that she is.",neutral

Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true - *possibly same as line above*

Snuck in through the garden gate - *past tense, what she did all this summer*

See how the upper sections are stacked on top of each other, so they're not further BACK from the field, they're just higher up? So theoretically, your 400 section is like right on TOP of a 200 section. 

Versus, for instance, Michigan's football stadium: [https://seatgeek.com/images/performers-landscape/michigan-wolverines-football-386c1f/5549/10547/720x450.jpg](https://seatgeek.com/images/performers-landscape/michigan-wolverines-football-386c1f/5549/10547/720x450.jpg)

Here, you can see that every row up is also further away from the field. The stadium is built more OUT than UP, like at State Farm Stadium.

I dont know many stadiums, so I couldnt immediately think of an NFL stadium that is ""bowl""-like, but I bet most are stacked since theyre generally built in cities (and therefore, space is at a premium, higher incentive to make the surface area of the stadium smaller). I'd just look at a photo of the stadium itself (not the seating chart, because that doesnt show if theyre overlapping) and see what it looks like!

Basically, you're just looking to see, are the upper sections also further back? or are they just higher? Like I said, I dont know if this would make a huge difference, but just a thought that it could!",neutral

"""revolution"" also is part of the reason the Rwandan genocide happened, the majority class that had less power literally genocided the minority ruling class and led to brutal disgusting crimes against humanity. Similar things happened in the Cuban Revolution, yeah many rich people who were slave owners faced consequences, but so many people got caught in the crosshairs as well. It creates refugees, trauma and lifelong hurt, at the end of the day, even people as rich as Taylor Swift are people capable of feeling pain. 

You can't both support violence and be a humanist that cares about people. Labeling that some people inherently ""deserve"" it will only create more corpses. Rich people are not an exception, there is never a valid reason to become violent towards another person outside of defense, and no ""defense"" does not mean attacking someone before they ""take over"" or creating some slippery slope fallacy to justify violence. 

I'm against the current system as much as anyone else, but treating people as ""the other"" has been a historically abhorrent way to go about things

This made me so uncomfortable. And then they'll talk about fans being discontent even though Beyonce breaks the record for the most Grammys every season. It's not about that though. Beyonce has a legacy and a cultural impact that would suggest she should've won a bunch of SOTY/ROTY/AOTY trophies. It's gross that she hasn't.",sexism

I never really liked the way she sorta talks about her early career being plagued by hardship when it honestly just wasn't. She got denied record deals at 13 by walking into places, but the fact that her mother would be able to dedicate that much time to driving her around and her father buying into BMR says a lot about what truly coming from nothing is.",sexism
"in all seriousness 

i think speak now would be like 1989 or evermore because speak now (my fav tay album) has bops like speak now, the story of us, etc. but it also had sad songs such as dear john, haunted (acoustic), back to december, etc. and that makes me think of evermore. but there‚Äôs only one reason it couldn‚Äôt be it‚Äôs favorite is because it‚Äôs not sonically cohesive and speak now is very greedy about those sort of things lol so it could also be 1989 because the production on a lot of speak now songs are very happy (story of us, haunted, etc.) and upbeat, and have the saddest lyrics, and so does 1989. but, 1989 only has like 3 or 4 or whatever sad songs where the production is different, and thats the probably the only problems with this match up. and that‚Äôs how we know taylor hasnt repeated and album (well maybe lover &amp; rep but rep is better soooo) ans reputation wouldnt work because it‚Äôs too happy, yk? and i feel like fearless, lover, and reputation are very similar and each other‚Äôs favorite because (well we know lover &amp; rep are dating but besides that) of how happy everything is about the album. the aesthetic (except for rep), the style of music, the lyrics, everything, and there are not many sad songs. there are definitely not exactly the same, no, because fearless is more .. high school? it just gives off that energy, and reputation is like i love you but i want you to fuck me and lover is just happy happy happy with no flavor (whitch is why its my least favorite album, but at least she didnt repeat another reputation, because she definitely could‚Äôve, just how she could‚Äôve made another cheerleader album like fearless with speak now, but instead made one of her best pieces of art) so yeah. i had to comment on what i think my favorite album‚Äôs favorite would be. 

here are my opinions:

debut: fearless

fearless: lover

speak now: evermore

red: folklore or (lol) 1989 (i just think that red would love to be happy and cohesive for once so it admires those things when looking toward 1989) 

1989: reputation (only because they sound very similar, or at least the most similar compared to other albums, but besides for that, no other album really does it like 1989, 1989 was that bitch)

reputation: lover

lover: reputation or (lol) fearless (only because of the thing i desercibed earlier, but lover also thinks fearless is better than her and that herself was only a copy, so she is a little jealous, she also thinks that she got more success, so she is a little mad at fearless, but nonetheless, they still give off each other‚Äôs vibe.)

folklore: red or debut (idk why but it just has the same vibe because folklore is about finding yourself after heartbreak and just trying to get through each and every day, and in debut, shes also trying to find her place in this world. and i also had to put debut somewhere, so yeah.)

evermore: speak now or 1989

okay, and in less seriousness

1. in the lwymmd music video, red &amp; fearless are arguing with each other a lot; and seem to hate each other. i ship red x fearless lol

2. if rep + lover had a baby it would be fearless + 1989 because they are having sex and fearless isnt so it would be if fearless and 1989 were mashed together",neutral

"I believe among Swifties it might be slightly more disliked. It would likely be over-played and lose the hidden gem &amp; What If? angle and we would know it's success or lack thereof which does play a part in people and fans reception of things. The video and it's reception along with her performances of it are also variable of how it would be received.   

All that being said I do think it would gain many, many more casual fans that maybe didn't give Lover a shot or dismissed the album and maybe only got into later. It's rare when an album track is among the top daily streams and Cruel Summer is.  

I also don't think she had a heavy negative bias against her at the time or the rhyming criticism would of gained any momentum.",neutral

"She's saying someone, not anyone. She was very specific, which if it was meant for media, she wouldn't have written so ambiguous. Let's be clear she was praised for writing her lyrics with clarity. If my suspicion is correct, that event took place very recently, in fact was in 2019.  
I know she wears more than one hats. In fact it is what she is proud of. But I think her choosing to take on acting jobs again definitely was a intentional choice. It is extremely rare for artists to cross over, unless they show they can do it. Even now JLo is regarded as mainly a singer, when she started as an actor actually and she has been consistently acting in films, and being considered decent, yet per her own words recently, she felt she was an outsider of the Hollywood. Cats is an ensemble film. It has many problems, not least acting. In fact it's more to do with materials, and directing. Such a film won't show case whether one is a good or bad actor. No, I am talking about her much earlier tries, like you said her several attempts before 2014, such as Valentine's Day, that one episode in a TV series (I forgot the name and not really interested in looking it up), and that African movie. She was not good in them. I think she knew. That's why she stopped and focused on her own lane. Cause repeated appearing bad at acting will indirectly harm her reputation, and therefore singing career. But then since 2019, she decided to take on acting again.  
Re Trying to directing: I think you missed grammar here. Try to do something means she tried and did it; Try doing something is she tried and half-assed it.  
""Are you saying these are connected to someone trying to tear her and Joe apart?"": No. I think at this point we should all admit that she is a bit pettier and very competitive. The megastar I was referring to is someone that is also a multitalent and is very powerful. I wouldn't say they tried to tear she and Joe apart, but we know her, she has always been private (even before Reputation), but since 2016, she became even more private. The incident is more like someone used her and Joe's private relationship as an example and more as a praise in a tabloid, but nevertheless it was her relationship and privacy, and she felt powerless to prevent the article being published (man, I already said too much), which I think it not only made her feel her privacy being intruded, but her ego being bruised, because let's face it, she is a superstar in her own right, and she has always been pride that she could use her songs to present her perspective and her narrative, which itself is a power play, since she's a public figure and a woman and men (except John Mayer and perhaps Calvin Harris) usually can't defend themselves, per social code. Kanye West tried to make a bruhaha, but we all know the result. Anyway, I think this event that took place in 2019 really triggered her and because the megastar is not only so powerful, but also their identity actually was hidden from the public view (except people in industry), she felt powerless, not just being unable to pull strings to take down the article, she actually couldn't even write a song to address them, which I believe really drives her mad. And her taking on acting again as well as directing is more of a response to prove herself.",sexism

So, as much as I love the re-recordings so far, and fully support the reasoning behind them, I feel like some, if not most of the songs lack a certain flair that made them so special. I feel like the emotion has been lost in some parts of the songs and you can tell she‚Äôs trying to mimick how she felt. And some of the songs just sound a little ‚Äôdifferent‚Äô with her newer vocals. All of this is understandable as it‚Äôs been over a decade since Fearless and Red, but it does make me realise that as much as I love her newer vocals, I miss the originals of many songs. Also, I‚Äôve noticed a few production errors or glitches on Red TV and sadly it ruins the overall experience for me. I‚Äôm becoming increasingly worried for the future re-recordings.",neutral

Well I think that the higher the number of songs the higher the streams of an album are isn‚Äôt true at all.

"This is really my issue. I realize people can make their own decisions about whether or not to purchase the variants without having heard the album yet, but with the many variants and the staggered releases, Taylor's team is clearly banking on people's FOMO and it feels predatory. I know she is not the only artist who does this - and I would criticize anyone else who did the same - but I don't feel like that makes it okay. And that combined with the fact that we've hardly gotten promotion outside of a few behind the song clips and track titles just makes it all feel not very fun to me, you know? I think I'd feel \*slightly\* better about it if we at least had a single or some song snippets or if the variants came out after the album dropped.",neutral

Yes capitalism works both ways, supply and demand. Apparently there's enough demand for this ugly overpriced merch to justify selling it.

"Totally agree - I think lot of her of songs, like Midnight Rain, are inspired by various relationships and/or experience that she found similar.

I love how you explained what Midnight Rain is about - the speaker making a *choice* to pursue her career and in turn, having to make a choice to leave behind another type of life. She ultimately got what she always wanted but she is sometimes haunted by her own decisions. I obviously don‚Äôt relate to turning down a man to go be a pop star but I love this song bc I often find myself haunted by my choices. Wondering what could‚Äôve been. The emotions this song evokes really resonate with me. The person(s) who inspired the song doesn‚Äôt really matter. I think some people focus on her life too much.

As you said, the first google result if you look up lavender haze is (or was, before taylor‚Äôs song) urban dictionary and it does not mention anything about LGBTQ+. It‚Äôs definitely possible that she had no clue about the significance to queer people. She probably realized the significance after the lavender vinyl and that‚Äôs why she made the reel to clarify it‚Äôs about her current relationship with Joe because she knew people would speculate even more that she was in a gay relationship if she didn‚Äôt. 

I agree that no one deserves to be harassed/bullied over this. However, the term homophobia is being thrown around a bit too much. It‚Äôs not homophobic to simply disagree, even when it‚Äôs regarding something like this. Half the people disagreeing are queer themselves and then they get told they just have internalized homophobia. It‚Äôs a bit insensitive.",neutral

"That's interesting with its comparison to Exile. 

Honestly, I wanted a part 2 of My Tears Ricochet itself. 

The other person trying to seek redemption (In this case, Scott Borchetta gathering the resources to buy the masters back from Shamrock and give them back to Taylor Swift without compensation). Would she have forgiven him if he did that? Would it lead to a My Tears Ricochet part 2?

I want to point out to those who expected an album this summer because I keep seeing comments. I'd bet a lot of money it got pushed because Beyonce is coming out with an album this summer. Taylor can't/wouldn't want to compete with that. Especially at the Grammys. Her label might gamble to either release closer to the Grammys or wait till next year. There were a lot of signs that an album was supposed to be announced/come out this summer but I no longer think that's the case.,neutral

"Fans think it‚Äôs just Taylor behind a computer clicking and pressing buttons, deciding who got tickets and who didn‚Äôt. The entitlement has been atrocious. By shifting blame onto Taylor her own fans are basically helping ticketmaster take the heat off of them. There are things she should be criticized for (multiple merch and vinyl release waves, remixes, whatever the boosted thing really meant, private jet, etc) but this isn‚Äôt one of them. 

Head empty zero thoughts from some fans. She shouldn‚Äôt have sold tickets through ticketmaster? Where is she going to play then, especially in the US. And when she can‚Äôt meet demand because the independent, non-TM affiliated venues are too small? Her fans will blame her anyway, but for another thing. 

From reading many posts since the presale some fans have a very unhealthy ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with Taylor. They act like Taylor is their bestie because they dropped thousands on her stuff. Look, that‚Äôs on them and it isn‚Äôt her fault they can‚Äôt control themselves. She‚Äôs a businesswoman. As a fan I am under no delusion she will ever know me or even care about me beyond what I spend on her music. If I don‚Äôt like her stuff I simply won‚Äôt buy it (ie. the remixes, merch). Their comments about it being traumatic and dehumanizing (said seriously and not jokingly) gave me a laugh because they‚Äôre off the deep end for sure.",neutral

"Yes! This is what I want! Taylor just singing from her heart and not trying to replicate! Replicating is way too hard so the best is to just sing from the heart. It's also okay for the production to sound a bit different! Despite a bit of a difference, it sounds clean rather than rushed! A bit different but clean rather than trying too hard to replicate and sounding choppy. I really hope for more on 1989 TV because the two 1989 songs are my favorite of hers when it comes to rerecordings",neutral

Tbh I feel like this is the second album I‚Äôm most excited for the re-record. Rep is my #1 forever and always so I‚Äôll probably die when that comes out but besides that I‚Äôm really looking forward to debut. I was never a fan and honestly can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve even listened to it all the way through once but I feel like her mature vocals will do wonders for this album.,neutral
"Taylor is untouchable at this point. Anything she does is going to be mainstream and a commercial success. She‚Äôs not going to push away listeners because she‚Äôs not making another Folklore/Evermore. Part of being an artist is exploring your artistry. Most of the imagery for Midnights has been very seventies, lo-fi style, so I wonder if it‚Äôs more Blondie, Fleetwood Mac inspired pop instead of the 1989 pop. Reputation had a bit of an eighties synth vibe, and Lover was very nineties bubblegum pop-ish. Pop is a very diverse genre and she‚Äôs already created three very unique pop albums with three very different sounds. I‚Äôm excited to see where she goes next.",neutral
I love Ashley,sexism
Agree on the first two. BTTWS seems like it‚Äôs about general loss and can fit a variety of situations. I think it would be more likely about Taylor‚Äôs friend who had a miscarriage and not Taylor herself. But who knows? It‚Äôs literally no one‚Äôs business but hers. And don‚Äôt get me started on the Lavendar Haze thing. It‚Äôs reminds me of when my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me wear red or blue because she was worried I‚Äôd get shot by a gang member in my high school.

It‚Äôs a boss move imo. Also, she‚Äôs currently working on her concerts. I disagree that her music isn‚Äôt political. In feminism, the personal is the political, and she‚Äôs done a beautiful job of that. Re-recording all her albums is extremely political. It boils down to different interpretations I guess.",sexism

"I haven't read the comments, so I don't know if others have talked about this.

I love her honesty. People who cheat are...people. 

When I was a teenager, I cheated and was cheated on. Then I ""grew up"" and was faithful during my first marriage. Amicable divorce.

My second marriage began beautifully, and I felt so aware of my past issues and trauma and so in love. Then came pregnancy, motherhood, depression, and all the unprocessed shit I'd never dealt with...

I'm sure there are people out there who cheat gleefully. In my experience, people who cheat are miserable in some way, not necessarily because the relationship is shit or their person is terrible. It might be that, or it might be that we're unhealed from past hurts or traumas, we've never known real love or self-love, we've never learned what we really need or want or how to identify or ask for what we need or want. Sometimes we don't know why.

I will never be okay that I hurt my husband. 

I *also* don't shame myself for what I did because I know it doesn't define me.

We've done a lot of healing and have a lot more to do.

When people like Taylor write about cheating, they humanize it. It happens. It hurts. And people hurt and heal and understand and question and learn and keep living.",neutral

"I lowkey didnt like the song when it first came out. I hated how repetitive the chorus was and couldnt for the life of me understand why she sampled I'm Too Sexy For My Shirt. ""Shes so good at creating catchy hooks - why did she do that?!"" Said my silly brain. But then the MV dropped and I started to like it. Then the true meanings came out and I started to love it. 

Of course, hindsight changes things! I can now appreciate her sampling the song was an obvious signal to scooter buttface that HEY ARTISTS DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR WORK RECOGNISED. THIS IS HOW ITS DONE U JAGWEED. I also really appreciated all the little hints in the music video and the ending was iconic.

"I actually disagree with this assessment (marketing professional here). If there were any fans that weren't pulled in by folklore/evermore, a third album in an indie ""trilogy"" is unlikely to break through to them at large scale. I don't think a third indie album really reaches anybody new - especially because she's Taylor Swift and not an unknown entity.

Cuz when she revisits those songs she‚Äôs definitely revisiting the restaurant but she‚Äôs not still there in her life now. I‚Äôve seen so many critics of Taylor saying how it‚Äôs weird that she‚Äôs still singing about exes from years ago, like with the new release of All Too Well 10, and then claiming that it must mean she hasn‚Äôt moved on but she HAS.

1. Taylor‚Äôs contract is legal, she has never claimed opposite. The label owning the masters is (or was) the most common practice. The contract is not result of ignorance or not read it. Taylor has never say a word about that.

2. Taylor offer to buy her masters, Scott use them as a blackmail tool and when didn‚Äôt succeed he sold to someone that his misstreat Taylor. Here is the total lack of moral and the main reason for Taylor doing the tv version (and money of course).

I literally always skip the last 2 mins. It feels like there are 3 or 4 different places that it could end and it just doesn't which makes the 10 minute version feel a bit gimmicky.

The verses in the OG were just absolutely perfect for packing a PUNCH of feels. I will never not feel all the feels when I hear the original. It's \*chefs kiss\*. I think the general consensus is that Red TV was missing a lot of the magic of the original album and I think that extends to ATW also. But in general I still love both of the 5 min versions.

"&gt;Queen of England

Did you mean the *former* [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the *former* [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the *former* [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Wasn't Queen Elizabeth II still also the Queen of England?*

This was only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she *was* the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

"I really love Midnights! Listening to the album for the first time was so exciting! I feel like it‚Äôs a good return to pop for her, certainly an evolution of her previous pop albums. I love the darker, moodier production. I love her exploration of all types of midnights, self-hatred to self-love, falling in and out of love, grief, revenge, everything. And I‚Äôve heard that people are disappointed by the lyrics and comparing them to folkmore lyrics, but I could write a whole essay on the lyrics of Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve alone! I thought the lyrics were a good combination of glitter gel pen, quill, and fountain pen. It felt like an especially good balance on this album.

The thing that I love most about Taylor is that she can do any genre and do it well. As such, I wasn‚Äôt necessarily expecting any specific sound from this album. I think a lot of the disappointment I‚Äôm hearing from swifties lies in the fact that they were expecting a folkmore sound, or a 70s retro sound, or a rock sound and were sad when this album wasn‚Äôt that. I can empathize with that feeling, the first time I listened to folklore, it was VERY different from anything she‚Äôd done before. I could appreciate the album, but it wasn‚Äôt my style at first. Now it‚Äôs definitely grown on me! So I would say for the next album, remember to keep an open mind about genre! I‚Äôm sure Taylor will surprise us again.",neutral

Okay thank you for sharing! I‚Äôm unfollowing her rn",neutral
"1. I like to revisit this album when I'm feeling jaded as it's sure to remind me about the sanctity and sacrilege of love again. It's sonically warm and bright and is really underrated production-wise. Plus, her vocal performance on this album is also criminally overlooked. Warm, shiny and youthful though delicate in its phrasing. And aside from a few songs, it shows off the most compelling and appealing facets of Taylor's personality.

2. I'd rank Speak Now very highly. It's my second favourite album in her discography, right below Folklore. Its writing is more refined, smarter and more contemplative than Fearless, it's less bloated and more sonically evocative than Red, (sorry!) and its lyrics are more detailed and emotionally nuanced than anything off of 1989 and Reputation. I'd actually put Speak Now and Lover on the same footing if not for Lover's god-awful singles rollout, (besides Lover and The Archer - The Archer in particular matches the calibre of Back to December). I'd also say that Speak Now is more personal than Evermore which allows Taylor to retain more of her personality on her songs, (though admittedly Evermore is more fictional narrative than autobiography). Just personal preference really, nothing against Evermore.

3. Back to December, Dear John and Last Kiss are my favourite tracks. BTD analyses a relationship from both parties and deals an even hand to both. It refreshingly abandons the often myopic ""narrowness"" her songs usually inhibit where the only side represented is her own. BTD also has an emotional, coming-of-age swell that delivers generous doses of wisdom and self-awareness - a good look for her. Dear John is long but is able to build impressive momentum for it to practically soar in the last chorus. This is perhaps her nastiest song that she has ever penned to an ex. Its lyrics contain enough cutting detail to humiliatingly put him on blast as well as narrate how she survived him like how one would wish away a bad memory. Finally, Last Kiss is tender, well-intentioned and fragile. Vulnerability is also a good look for her.

4. I got into it later because it was the one Taylor album that didn't have any commercially successful hits in my country - I wished it did :(

5. To conclude, Speak Now was a rare moment in time that can never be replicated. It's a highly enjoyable listen with no skips. Each song has just enough dynamic variability to give the tracklist momentum so that it doesn't run out of steam. No song is incongruous which makes for a cohesive album. I'll also stand by the fact that this album solidified her ability to write a good bridge.",neutral

"Chat Gpt's thoughts:

Question: ""Lover, the seventh studio album by Taylor Swift, is estimated to chart at number 14 on the billboard 200 albums chart over one hundred weeks after its release. Why does it have so much longevity, compared to her other albums such as folklore, evermore, and Reputation?""  
Answer ""There are several factors that could contribute to the longevity of Taylor Swift's album ""Lover"" compared to her other albums.  
""Firstly, ""Lover"" was released in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted the music industry. With the pandemic, live concerts and events were cancelled or postponed, leading to a decrease in album sales and streams for many artists. As a result, albums released before the pandemic, such as ""Lover,"" may have had an advantage in terms of longevity.  
""Secondly, ""Lover"" has a more mainstream pop sound compared to Swift's more recent albums, ""folklore"" and ""evermore,"" which have a more indie-folk sound. While ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" were critically acclaimed and commercially successful, their more niche sound may have limited their appeal to a wider audience and led to a shorter chart lifespan.  
""Lastly, ""Reputation,"" Swift's 2017 album, had a more controversial and polarizing theme and tone, which could have contributed to a shorter chart lifespan compared to ""Lover."" ""Reputation"" also had a more hip-hop and electronic sound, which may not have had the same mainstream appeal as the more traditional pop sound of ""Lover.""  
""Overall, the longevity of ""Lover"" on the Billboard 200 albums chart could be attributed to a combination of factors, including its release timing, mainstream pop sound, and less polarizing theme and tone compared to Swift's other recent albums.""",neutral

"While it‚Äôs technically called the Eras Tour, she‚Äôs obviously going to focus mostly on Midnights. So while Long Live would be a good ending, I highly highly doubt it‚Äôll be anything other than a midnights song. 

So in saying that, Bejeweled is the only clear answer to this question. 

She always ends her tours on an upbeat, fun to dance to song (WANEGBT, Shake It Off, TIWWCHNT) that leaves everyone in the stadium buzzed and excited. Plus Bejewled being about her comeback to pop music makes it perfect, considering her new pop album has managed to sell out stadiums of tickets in only a few days. 

I also believe the last line of Bejeweled is written to be the final line sung on tour. Just imagine Taylor singing ‚ÄúI can still make the whole place shimmer‚Äù while the light up wrist bands go crazy, there‚Äôs fireworks going off, the crowd is cheering, there‚Äôs confetti everywhere, and Taylor‚Äôs looking into the crowd smiling.

My best friend had the deluxe version, and I was envious because I thought the red dress was so beautiful. At the time I enjoyed it much more than Fearless/Debut, and now it's ranked 6 out of 9.

Speak Now falls off my radar, but every time I go back it's an absolute no skip. Sparks Fly, Back to December, Dear John, Innocent, Enchanted, Last Kiss, Long Live... those songs not only got me through the second half of college, but reminded me of high school and made me feel nostalgic of times gone by, and things that happened what felt so long ago.

Favorite lyric: Either ""And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe"" or ""And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said 'run as fast as you can'""

Other fun facts:

"I'm glad I made you laugh! In all seriousness though, this is one of my pet peeves about swifties. All of these comments are inherently selfish and do nothing for Taylor as an artist or person.

""Be on social media!"" ""Tell us how to vote!"" ""Be more involved with your merch team!"" ""Be what WE miss about you!""

I've noticed a lot lately that swifties are refusing to let Taylor grow up. There's a lot of ""We want 1989 Taylor back!"" without acknowledging how harmful that era was to Taylor's mental and physical health. 

She seems to have reached a really good work/life balance. I truly believe Taylor never wanted to be anything more than a singer/songwriter, and she's shown with folklore and evermore that is exactly what she's going to be. She's also shown that she knows her name and voice carries weight, but can you imagine that burden? If she starts speaking up all the time, it'll turn into, ""Go back to singing"" and ""Why did you talk about this but not this?""

Plus, she's in a longterm happy relationship, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if they're at a point where they're discussing when/if to start a family. Put on top of that her mother's health, and any rational person should understand why Taylor has taken a step back and decided to simply do the job she wanted to do 15 years ago.",neutral

"In what sense, source? 

This song finds Swift singing about the romantic adventures of Ethel and Bobby Kennedy after coming across a photo of the pair dancing when they were teenagers. ""She told The Wall Street Journal: ""I get a lot of style inspiration from the 1960s, so I'll go and look at black and white pictures, and look at [photos from the] '50s and '60s, and I came across this picture of these two kids dancing at a dance. It immediately made me think of like how much fun they must have had that night. It was back in the late '40s. I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. And they were like 17. So I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that. And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like, you have to meet my mom. She would love to meet you. So that was kind of what that song was about.""

OOTW: ‚Äúyou took a Polaroid of us, then discovered, the rest of the world was black and white, but we were in screaming color‚Äù 

Question: ‚Äúwe had one thing going on I swear that it was something cuz I don‚Äôt, remember who I was before you painted all my nights, a color I have searched for since.‚Äù

Also, in OOTW, she‚Äôs literally asking a question - ‚ÄúAre we out of the woods yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we in the clear yet?‚Äù

Being that OOTW is a song about Harry, I think it‚Äôs quite safe to say Question is a Harry song as well! Not that this matters to everyone, because we all take these songs and weave them into our own worlds, but I do think it‚Äôs fun to know who Taylor is referencing in songs that are about her own life. It also can enrich the song and give more context to an otherwise maybe confusing storyline like I think some may be finding Question to be!",neutral

"Hi everyone! Thanks for joining the fun game of trying to catch the references I put into this!

I took this photo before final touch ups that included coloring in the paper airplane with white ink, some additional shading/highlighting on the bow. Here are some notes on my tattoo when I was discussing my idea to the artist:

- The Archer: bow and arrow (shout out to /u/idontwannalive123 for letting me use their taytoo as reference and inspiration!) 
- Daylight: gold color. the issue here was that the gold ink was too close to my skin color so it wasn't showing up. that means i'm already golden. kidding aside, we swapped to a lighter yellow shade so it would float on my skin better
- Ivy: covering the bow + ""crescent moon, coast is clear..."" 
- Don't Blame Me: ""I once was poison ivy but now I'm your daisy"" so I requested them at the ends of the bow (bonus: 13 leaves + flowers - I think someone did catch it!) 
- Out of the Woods: paper airplane, I think everyone caught it.   It was a unique twist on the arrow head that I hadn't seen done before.
- Stay is a recurring theme in many of Taylor's songs, could be from the Archer ""who could ever leave me darling, but who could stay"" or from Stay, Stay, Stay or from All You Had to Do Was Stay. There's also Stay Beautiful from debut. I chose the folklore/evermore font IM Fell for it. Bonus: s - tay is like swift taylor haha
- seven: heart and moon for ""love you to the moon (and to saturn)"" but the heart is also more general for all her love songs (esp lover) 
- Willow: the arrow tail is actually willow leaves! no one caught on to that yet i think
- invisible string: it's not very visible (because it's meant to be invisible) but there are wisps of strings around the arrow and stay that are golden. i think someone did see it! 
- cardigan: again since I snapped this photo before it was actually completely finished (woops) i do have a small star outside of the bow and arrow, near the keloid scar for ""you drew stars around my scars""

When she said that I actually thought I might end up liking Midnights more than Folklore. I got really excited to hear it and when then I listened to Lavender Haze first and was like.....really?

I didn't like any of the songs until I got to Anti-Hero and then I was like well I guess this will be one of my least favorite albums. There are some songs on it I really like but overall I wouldn't say it resonated with me emotionally or made me think of things that keep me up at night.

Hits Different, Cruel Summer, I Think He Knows, Come Back...Be Here, All Too Well 10min, Death By A Thousand Cuts

Quite a few: Out of The Woods, Snow On The Beach, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, All You Had To Do Was Stay

"I have to agree with this even though I'm one of those ""music is subjective!!!!!"" people. Sure, you don't have to like the sound of her music. I don't expect a hip hop fan to love evermore, or a heavy metal fan to love 1989. But those people need to at least respect her song writing. I feel like she has proven herself time and time again that she is not a one trick pony who just so happened to write ONE really good song one day. She has multiple insanely well-written songs, even full albums, it's just pure talent at this stage. People can say the sound isn't for them but I think her songwriting needs to be universally respected, even though music is subjective.",neutral

I do agree to an extent that reviews don‚Äôt matter, especially in terms of whether or not I like something. My only worry with reviews is that there is a big possibility for preferential treatment when it comes to artists like Taylor and overly negative reviews from big outlets are essentially off limits, and those are conveniently the same outlets that are weighed higher.

the first verse has to be catchy &amp; hook the audience, so there‚Äôs always a quotable line or two; the chorus is the chorus; the bridge is Taylor‚Äôs main event; second verses are usually a bit more specific because they are deeper into the storyline, so less relatable and less quote able?

He was her producer through the years when she was growing into a huge sensation and I feel like albums such as Fearless, Speak Now and Red are going to go down as true classics not only in Taylor‚Äôs discography but also in all of music history when all is said and done. That run of three albums were Taylor at her absolute best imo and will be looked back on very fondly by many. 

After him, I‚Äôd probably say Dessner as I‚Äôm a big fan of his style and musicianship, I think he works very well with folky Taylor and him also being a talented musician helps a ton in formulating the music.

Martin is probably a somewhat close third since he objectively comes up with true pop hits and has been involved in some of Taylor‚Äôs classics. 

Jack is a distant fourth for me, just not a fan of his production at all with any artist he‚Äôs worked with. A lot of his stuff is very stale to me and I think some of Taylor‚Äôs worst writing has occurred when he‚Äôs involved. Some very good songs for sure but overall not my thing.",neutral

"I don‚Äôt agree with everything in the article but I do think that it‚Äôs a very true point that many fans of colour have felt excluded or marginalised at some point. Country music certainly has a very racist white oriented past which I doubt many would dispute, going back to old tales of ‚Äúcowboys shooting Indians‚Äù to the Dixie Chicks being deafeningly cancelled for years just for voicing support for innocent Middle Eastern lives. As a visible Muslim woman of colour I‚Äôve always loved the storytelling and instrumental aspects of country music from a comfortable distance, feeling with good justification that a lot of country music culture probably doesn‚Äôt like my very existence and that I‚Äôm not interested in trying to win their approval either. It‚Äôs a bit better now but it still remains that country music has been steeped in racism since it‚Äôs inception in many ways. Not that all country artists and fans are racists of course but just that it‚Äôs always been a context sadly, sometimes allowed to lurk in the background and other times directly at the forefront. 

Taylor always did a good job of welcoming fans to country music in a way that didn‚Äôt seem to retain a lot of these racist elements, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there weren‚Äôt some microaggressions from the start amongst the fan base some of which remain to this day.

I don‚Äôt want to get too long or make overly broad declarative statements on behalf of all minority Swifties but just one other point is I feel that the undercurrent in a lot of Swiftie communities that I find currently most problematic as a Swiftie of colour is the seeming defensiveness a lot of Swifties have to present Taylor as oppressed in all circumstances. Sometimes in way that are very upsetting. I remember during the whole Weeknd nomination situation a ton of Swifties on Twitter and TikTok especially almost seemed uncomfortable to have the discussion on someone other than Taylor facing a form of discrimination other than misogyny in the music world. The discussion was a lot broader than one individual album or song being snubbed, with many people using it as an opportunity to explore broader problems of racism in the music industry. I probably read literally over a hundred takes in a short frame of time basically completely undermining any idea of racism in the Grammy‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs been way more oppressed as a woman than any male musician of any race‚Äù in subtler ways (or sometimes literally just that).

"That's definitely fair! I'm thinking of songs like Cornelia Street - if she described that song in a little ""behind the song"" clip, she might just talk about the feelings of falling in love and the anxiety of losing that person and what will happen if she does lose them. But the song is actually about some very specific moments in a relationship: the moment in the backseat of the car when you start to fall, windows open in the autumn air, the moment when she leaves but then they call so she turns around and they sit up on the roof together, standing barefoot in the kitchen, etc. It can be described generally, like the songs on Midnights so far, but the song is actually a snapshot of moments and stories.

"i want Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac vibes. i love the 70s aesthetic and i hope that carries over into the sound of the album.

"I feel like what I‚Äôm about to say will be highly controversial in this sub, but I think Folklore and Evermore are overrated (by swifties, not the general public). Yes, her lyricism and figurative language are beautiful, but I missed the ‚Äúbops‚Äù, ya know?

I personally hope that Midnights is like a blend of 1989 and Reputation (This Love, Wildest Dreams, So It Goes, I Know Places, etc). There‚Äôs nothing better than 1989 for yelling at the top of your lungs while you‚Äôre driving, giving you a spring in your step while you‚Äôre walking, and just making you feel confident and gorgeous and like you can take on the world. It‚Äôs an album of straight bops, no skips (in my opinion, I know some swifties have strong feelings about Bad Blood). I feel like if Midnights is anything like 1989, it‚Äôll be a smash success and I personally am keeping my fingers crossed for ‚Äú1989 after dark‚Äù",neutral
"Well... I'm not saying that Taylor is absolutely needing right now that he makes a sincere apology, and you also don't know the opposite. The point is that in general when someone clearly has not been sincere in an ""apology"" because he has blamed to others about all of that (in this case to the interviewer and Los Angeles Times), in general the correct thing would be that this person rectifies and makes a real and sincere apology assuming his own words and not blaming to others about what he said. And this can't be bad for anyone, on the whole, it would be a possitive thing for the person against he spoke, for the persons he blamed, and for himself.",neutral

Homegirl‚Äôs a legacy artist with an enormous (and ever-growing) back catalog. There‚Äôs no way she/her future estate won‚Äôt release old music, videos, etc in order to solidify her legacy. Taylor knows we froth at the mouth for content from previous eras. Plus, she LOVES surprising her fans, and she‚Äôs got *decades* ahead of her to bring out surprise unreleased tracks from the past. Think reissues. Think box sets. Think memoirs. Think documentaries. All of those things are going to include content we‚Äôve never seen before.

"&gt;it‚Äôs possible that the sounds you‚Äôre not enjoying aren‚Äôt Jack‚Äôs decisions but Taylor‚Äôs.

I mean... yeah, I'm a fan of how Taylor uses her talents, but not a fan of Jack's, and that totally okay. It's not like you're saying anything that makes the disappointment any different. She isn't being forced to work with him

If she didn't hire him for the album, I would probably be more excited to hear a different producer's interpretation of what she asks. But that's not to say I'm not excited and still looking forward to what he has to offer, anything is possible and I hope (if this means he is part of the album) that he proves me wrong - which he already does sometimes. My tears ricochet? Dress? Falso God? Great production. 

&gt;Taylor has full creative control over all of her albums. 

I mean, yes, to a degree. Like a lot of times producers make something first and she works with it, which would mean that she didn't come up with the sound herself, she collaborated. If she wanted full, and I mean COMPLETE control, she would perform/produce/mix/master/engineer every little aspect - which if you check the personnel of her albums, it's a safe bet to say she doesn't have that.

But as far as yes/no's go, yeah, I'd say she has full control over approving or disapproving, if that's what you meant.",neutral

"Apologies if this has already been posted before as I just noticed it myself this morning! If you look on Taylor's Youtube channel under the ""Rep Tour and Friends"" playlist, you'll see music videos for all of her friends that joined her on shows during the Reputation tour.

You'll also see a random outlier on video 6. This video is by a group known as The Broods and shows the music video for their song ""Peach"" from 4 years ago.

Immediately upon watching the video the first screen shows ""Midnight"" and then the camera pans to the desk where it zooms in on a clock. The entire song is what I would imagine the style of Midnights might be.

My question now is: Have people noticed this before? How long has this been there? Was it added to this playlist recently or a few years ago?

- Mean. Thank you. This song is iconic and one of my absolutely favorite of hers. I wish both Mine and Mean could make it but it had to be one song, this was the one. 

I am surprised Exile didn't make it. It is the only real surprise to me out of the excluded ones.

I honestly think Bad Blood, I Don't Wanna Live Forever and You Need to Calm Down are some of her worst singles and not particularly good songs so...

"[It‚Äôs more complicated than that](https://projects.propublica.org/americas-highest-incomes-and-taxes-revealed/) 

People avoid high taxes by either avoiding income and living off profit from investments or making large charitable contributions out of stock holdings and then writing them off. 

Taylor isn‚Äôt a publicly traded company. So she doesn‚Äôt have stock. So she‚Äôs not evading taxes by paying capital gains rates or by writing off stock as a deduction after donating to charity. 

She‚Äôs making her money from income. You can‚Äôt actually just avoid paying taxes because you‚Äôre rich, most rich people avoid paying taxes through manipulating tax law based around stock holdings. 

She‚Äôs most likely actually paying taxes on her wealth including property taxes on her homes and taxes on her personal income. 

Not to mention, if she lives in the UK as well she may be paying taxes there also. There‚Äôs no way to know all the details because that‚Äôs private but since she has no publicly traded companies to use to skirt tax law it‚Äôs a fair bet that she‚Äôs paying a normal tax rate.",sexism

"I think there are many ways to interpret this song and it touches on several themes such as eating disorders or losing friends. But I think the overarching idea is that even with friends/family at the end of the day your mind is your own; inside your noggin we really ARE all alone (notwithstanding certain psychiatric conditions). That's how I took it, your dynamic with other people or how we present ourselves or who we let into our lives and to what degree they have a say on our behaviour can change, but all of us have, are, and will always just be.....ourselves - we cant be someone else and no one else can be us FOR us if we dont want to exist.

"TBH my biggest concern about all of this is who she's gonna work with in her movie, and it's not about if she cast actors that are close to her like Joe Alwyn, Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively, but it's more like‚Ä¶ what if she's working with problematic/controversial people? You can't deny that some of her decisions have been a bit controversial lately, like starring in Amsterdam which has a problematic director; making a soundtrack for Crawdads whose author had a controversial history; casting Miles Teller for her MV (he was controversial at that time for not getting the vaccine, I think?); even the fact that she's still friends with Lena Dunham who also had a bit of problematic history.

I feel like this could be more serious than how she got the movie deal or whether the movie would be good or not. People will still say bad things about an objectively good movie, and some bad movies are still enjoyable and good for some people.

"I think that there will be exclusive song snippets before the album's released, but that was only supposed to be announced at midnight EST at the same time Taylor drops the first snippet. I may be wrong, though, we'll only know at midnight EST.

But I think it doesn't make sense to cancel a (in my opinion genius) marketing strategy just because some fans didn't like it, because for sure there are other fans that liked it and because that would start a wave of spontaneous content that promotes the album for free and that brings the GP's attention towards the album's release.",neutral
Why surprise is on 3 a.m though?  Does Taylor have a lot of lyrics about 3 a.m.?,neutral

I really love this ranking system because it gives me more range to determine what my true feelings on each song are. Each album gets to stand on its own two feet, and I decided to rank it on a points system from highest score to lowest score. I also made sure to only focus on the standard edition of each album, so all bonus tracks are excluded from these rankings since every album deserves its fair shot. I've tried grading and rating the albums out of 5-10 before, but I wasn't ever satisfied with the results, so I decided to stick with this ranking system from now on. It's perfect in every way.",neutral

"I haven‚Äòt listened too many songs on Speak Now and debut, like for real I never listened to Enchanted or Back to December-some of her most acclaimed songs. It‚Äòs a little weird considering the fact I‚Äòm listening to Taylor since 2012 when Red came out. Though to be fair I only listened to Red because I was on a plane and had nothing else to do as my phone had died and I was in no mood for movies and well Taylor Swift was the only artist I knew on their selection so I gave it a try and listened to the entirety of red. I bought the album the moment I got back home.

After that I listened to some of her other songs but never to a whole album again(except Red), I was more a causal listener and I was like Red has the best songs on anyway. I remember being really disappointed when I heard that Taylor was planing to switch to Pop because I liked Red, it wasn‚Äôt just country but not just pop either. I thought Taylor was going to do the same music as everyone else. I had little interest in 1989 until Blank Space and Shake it off started playing none stop everywhere and then I started listening to some songs on the album, but again not all. I was obsessed with Wildest dreams, my sister noticed and bought the album for my birthday. I was still skeptic but gave it a try and surprise surprise I loved it as well. I never really got into the Fandom though as that was also the time my One Direction phase started but still I listened too a lot Taylor Swift back in the day.

Then reputation: I don‚Äòt think anyone on the internet missed that announcement. Honestly it was a pop-culture moment. I was curious as anyone else and ended up loving Look what you made me do and the music video. I thought it was really clever and I think that‚Äòs the first time I started liking Taylor as a person and not just as a musician. I decided to listen to the entirety of Reputation before deciding to buy it and well again I loved it. After that I was pretty convinced that I only liked Taylors pop music as my most favorite songs came from her later albums so I never really though about listening to the first three, despite having listened to a few songs from them over the years.

When Taylor first announced Lover I was excited. I became less excited when I first heard me! And well I didn‚Äòt like You need to calm down much either (though I love the message behind the song!). When she released the archer I thought I might just grew out of Taylor Swift (that‚Äòs the only one I will apologize for but don‚Äòt worry I saw the light, now the Archer is in my top 20 songs from Taylor Swift). Still I listened to Lover and turns out I love every other song on the album. After that I started listening more to some of her old music like Dear John and stuff but before I could really get into them she announced that she would rerelease her albums and I just thought wouldn‚Äòt it be nice to listen to Taylor‚Äòs Version instead of the stolen ones? So I decided to wait. I‚Äòm actually really excited about the rerecording because of that. Feels like getting a whole new album with so many songs I didn‚Äòt know.

Listening to fearless for the first time was amazing and really made me appreciate Taylor more, as I always believed it to be a mehh album because it was country. True I don‚Äòt like it as much as some of her later works but I still think I would‚Äòve loved it if I had decided to listen to the entirety of the catalogue when I first started listening to her.",neutral

folklore: my tears ricochet
evermore: tis the damn season",neutral
"The last time TAK did the password thingy it was for The Weeknd/Post Malone collab, so I'm 50:50 on this one.",neutral
"- Ok, so a little background knowledge: I became a swiftie back in November of 2020, so evermore was not out yet. I was just experiencing all of her albums, especially folklore, and so once evermore did come out, I was excited, but I did not listen to it much/experience the album as a whole. Due to this, evermore has not been one of my favorite albums, and I rarely listened to it. Well, I have listened to it more over the past few weeks, and I thought I would tell my thoughts on it.

- To start, when I first listened to evermore back when it came out, it was a very bland album to me. There were some songs I liked, but none I would go out of my way and listen to. I was so obsessed with folklore at the time, that I would constantly compare the two and always thought folklore was the best and evermore was the boring sister album. 

- To move on, after listening to it for the past few weeks, I have to say, I really love evermore! Now that my folklore blinders are off, I no longer compare the two and appreciate each of them as they are. The whole vibe of evermore is wonderful! It is very cohesive and I like how it is very different to what Taylor has done before, even different from folklore.  Also, I thought I would tell all of you my favorites from the album, the songs I‚Äôve always liked, songs i originally disliked but now like, etc.

1. Always Liked - Willow, ‚ÄòTis the Damn Season, Tolerate It, No Body, No Crime, Long Story Short, Closure, Right Where You Left Me, and It‚Äôs Time To Go
2. Songs I originally disliked, but now like - Champagne Problems, Gold Rush, Happiness, Coney Island, Ivy, Cowboy Like Me, Marjorie, and Evermore
3. Song that I need more time to grow on me - Dorothea. 

Overall, I really love evermore and I am very glad I gave it another chance!",neutral

"I think she's really good at picking closers -- I'm trying to come up with a 'worst' and drawing a blank, I think they're all thematically appropriate and also just feel really good as album closers in some way.

But my vote for 'best' goes to Long Live. ""I had the time of my life... with you"" is just such a powerful note to end on. It feels like it's coming at the end of a twenty-year career, not the third album from a twenty-year-old.",neutral
"Agreed. Even with releasing 2 TV's per year, it's still 2 years of that, only freeing her up for TS10 and touring by 2024. And I really think she would wait until the TV's are all out to give them a chance to do well because they might get lost in the excitement of a TS10 and tour so it just makes sense to me. So exactly what you're saying, not re-releasing twice this year wouldn't make sense, she for sure has a plan.. Also, Taylor is getting sued ALL THE TIME from people trying to make money off her music. This is nothing new for her and her team, I have full confidence in them.",neutral

I'm a full time working mom of two. I cried along with Teardrops On My Guitar in my teen years as I taught myself to strum along on my own guitar. I immerse myself in each album and it gives me something to look forward to and feel excited about when everything else in life feels like the same old. 

My kids are just as obsessed and it's so fun to share Taylor with them. My four year old does a ""rock show"" with her version of LWYMMD that is to die for. My nine year old wants to be Taylor's BFF. I watch new videos with her first thing in the morning when they are released and then we talk about them, it's so much fun.

"Magnum opus can mean two things really, it can be simply a great work or a masterpiece. But it can also be the defining best piece of work across someone's career. I believe that Cardigan is a masterpiece, but I'm not sure it's her magnum opus if you mean it is truly the most important, defining work of her career. 

All Too Well 10 minute is probably widely viewed as a top contender as well, and despite loving both of the songs and Cardigan getting me through some stuff, I'd have to go with that one for now. Her career isn't over by any means, but ATW breathed new life into a song and turned it into something else entirely and the storytelling is wonderful in each of them.

Cardigan is definitely up there to me, but ATW 10 Minute is so treasured and loved for a reason, I think. It's kind of like how when you hear Stairway to Heaven for the 100th time, and maybe it's clich√© and overplayed because everyone loves it, but it's *still good* despite being as ""over exposed"" as a song can get. I view All Too Well 10 Minute in that way.

I do think Cardigan is vastly underappreciated for what it is though, and the lyrics are truly masterful.",neutral

"I think/hope that this is the scenario. An Evermore Long pond film for the 1st anniversary with an announcement of Speak Now TV to be released in February. Then a big splash around 1989 TV for early summer with some festivals and one off gigs. Taylor has said she plans tours meticulously so the back half of 2022 will be quiet while she does that.

At the end of 2022 a new single with TS10 released in April 2023 and a tour announcement for spring and summer 2023. I think Taylor has a fair bit of TS10 in the can already. She has been busy with re-recording but with all those producers and musicians and all that studio time she would not be able to help herself - ‚Äúoh I came up with this at 4am this morning what do you think Jack, Aaron etc.‚Äù

Of course all that may well be 100% wrong but unlike many other artists Taylor does not seem to be able to switch off.

"The soft harmonized ""ooohhhhhhh"" that she does twice in The 1, right after the first chorus and again at the very end. 

The way she sings ""under me"" in Seven right before ""are there still beautiful things""

How is gets so very quiet in the second chorus of Mirrorball after ""Hush,  I know they said the end is near. "" it's slightly quieter than the first chorus and I love how captivating that silence becomes. 

The ""aaahhhhhh"" s in the background of the Mad Woman outro. It just sounds seething.

""Oooohhhhooooohh"" in all of Dorothea. 

In The Archer when she harmonizes ""cause all of my enemies started out friends"" and how it is very intentional that the layered vocals don't align perfectly. 

The second half of the bridge in Wildest Dreams,  how she stresses ""hindSIGHT"" and ""all NIGHT, "" and then ""burning (burning) it (it) down (DOWNNN!)""

"I think Midnights has a chance at beating Drake‚Äôs Her Loss this week if Taylor pulls out a surprise of some sort to boost sales/streams. Her Loss only opened with 97m total streams(US is 51m) on Spotify yesterday and I‚Äôd expect a big drop tomorrow. Midnights is currently stable around 30m in US(opened with 185m worldwide).  Drake does get a greater percentage of his streams from Apple Music but they don‚Äôt report that data so that is big unknown.   Taylor has a built in advantage when it comes to physical sales. If she sells 50-100k more physicals(likely) than Drake that equals 75-150m streams worth of units.  So it could be close. 

Probably won‚Äôt be able to do it but I‚Äôd be watching this week to see if something special gets offered($5 digital downloads, more signed items, chance to get boosted from album purchase, 3am CDs, etc.).

"My Theory: Personally I'm expecting the single to drop either this Friday (02/09) or the Friday after that (09/09). She won't release it on the 16th because I don't think she'll want to compete with BLACKPINK who have their next big single that day. After the 16th it becomes a bit late to have a pre-release single, of course, unless there is no lead single and she just releases the album and lead single simultaneously like she did with folklore and evermore - which is certainly not impossible.

Second crack theory. Maybe she's gonna be a feature on the BLACKPINK song or a song off the album. Before today I had no reason to think that but then of course she shared that Tiktok with her singing their new song. I know typically that means nothing, shes also talked about being a fan of Nicki Minaj and such and nothing has come of that, but BLACKPINK is super prolific with features (their last era had features with Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez and Cardi B ofc) so you never know.",neutral

Yes she was struggling with her ED but that doesn't mean that every day of her life was hell, it wasn't untill towards the end of the era when things turn bad for her with the hate train

Like someone else here said, i doubt she was happy about Reputation untill the tour, she didn't do any interviews and we know she loves to talk about her music, the only single the mainstream cared about was LWYMMD, outside of pop circles and her fandom it seemed like nobody can unless it was in relation to the feud, the album didnt get nominated for the grammys and we know how much she cares about that

The tour is the thing that made her happy because it proved that she was still at the top and that people still loved her, she was filling stadium after people claiming that the would be empty, the people were still pleased and that's why she loved it

Things aren't black and white, just because you're sad today it doesnt mean you will be tomorrow, these eras laster 2/3 years each, it's too simplistic to say that she was fully happy or miserable during either of them",neutral

She remembers it, she loves it, she remembers the little details because she cares so much and he can‚Äôt even remember the big things. He doesn‚Äôt give what matters importance, much less the first fall of snow, but she does. She remembers the beauty of something so mundane but so beautiful all too well, and he could never. That line broke me because I understand to an extent her line of thought, breaking apart in her head, thinking desperately, ‚ÄòI even remember the snow, but you can‚Äôt remember me‚Äô and how she must have felt looking out the window at the snowfall and knowing he would never love her the way she loved him, because the love she felt even in that little moment for the snow for the beauty of the earth, he could never reciprocate even that much for her",neutral

"This is gonna be long XD

***White Horse*** is a masterpiece from the start to finish, the video is filmed so damn well, the flashbacks are amazing and the scene of the speech before the outro with her bursting into tears is too emotional to handle.

I'd say that her old country videos are underrated except of You Belong With Me, but Picture To Burn? Mine? The Story Of Us? Teardrops On My Guitar? Begin Again? And why Fifteen is so disliked then? It's so sweet.

Among the pop ones, ***Style*** is the most underrated one, unfortunately in that era there were Wildest Dreams, Blank Space and Bad Blood that overshowed it, but Style was different, it was something new, it perfectly encapulates the bittersweetness of the lyrics and it's imagery like the lyrics are. Everything said in the song is transformated in a image: car riding, red lipstick, James Dean look in your eyes, him taking off his clothes and what happens after and the open ending: do they come back together? Or not? Or they just see each other for a night and say goodbye? Style is a pure poetry. Style was a trendsetter. Show more love for Style.

Even ***Delicate*** is quite underrated, it shows that Joseph Khan is not just effects but he can create simple normal music videos but still impactful.. I understand that it doesn't follow the lyrics, but i think they wanted to go in a more conceptual storyline(just like the other videos of rep tbh and the whole rep itself) to show that she is free now, free to be herself cuz now she has someone who sees the person she is ,not the superstar. I think this video summerize the whole concept of reputation and ''why she disappeared'', first we have Taylor superstar followed by tons of securities guards, then she ''disappears'' and starts to dance, to realize her priorities and then she appears again but she just sees her lover, cuz now she doesn't care anymore to what people can say. It's really great. I love it.",neutral

I feel like if people don‚Äôt immediately need to grab a thesaurus they think it‚Äôs bad. They want it to be exactly like folklore and evermore, and odds are she‚Äôll never make an album like those again. A lot of fans only came on after folklore and evermore, and I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the issue is coming from. Midnights is quintessential taylor.

As for SNTV, 5/26 is a date that also makes sense that I haven't thought about till recently. So, I think that if she doesn't make an announcement for SNTV by the time the Grammy's come (Feb 5), SNTV will be released 5/26 (not 5/27 because that's a Saturday and she'll need to release on Friday to get the full sales numbers...plus, 5+2+6=13 lol). I think she's saving August (Or September/October) for 1989TV since it's been hinted at coming after SNTV and Tay knows it's the most anticipated re-record out of the ones remaining so she won't wait another year to release it.",neutral

3. Long Live - Memories of the good parts of a lost friendship, similar to Happiness which is not on this list. She liked fairy tale stuff a lot.

4. The Moment I Knew - I don‚Äôt relate that much but it‚Äôs just so pretty and cinematic. Please direct this music video, Taylor

5. Wildest Dreams - idk it‚Äôs just very sexy to me but like lingering sexy feelings for someone you can‚Äôt have. 

6. Call It What You Want - just completely encapsulates the theme of Rep and finding Joe as everything crashed around her. Also includes plenty of ‚Äúmy bf is hot‚Äù karma vibes

7. Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince - unpacking social expectations and the fine line women are expected to walk 

8. August - very summery. I spent August 2020 by the ocean cleaning out a relative‚Äôs house who had passed away and he had collected lots of bottles of wine 

9. Tis the Damn Season - just the feeling of brown trees, no snow yet, Christmas break and it‚Äôs a break in the narrative because everything is outwardly back to how it was even though you‚Äôve changed (Gold Rush and Champagne Problems were a close second bc this is my favorite album)

10. Maroon - it‚Äôs just very atmospheric and poetic and I love when she sings in a lower register

"I'm a Nathan Chapman girlie for life. Taylor's first four albums are SO iconic, and that has a lot to do with Nathan making those songs sound full, almost orchestral. There's so much going on in the background and the songs sound so rich, that's why I go back to those 4 again and again on my favorites list. Watching videos of him working with Taylor is so much fun, and I feel like he really understood her musical style and could match the music to the lyrics perfectly. 

I've been disappointed with the rerecordings because Christopher Rowe just doesn't seem to be able to match the fullness that Nathan had in the original recordings. The Taylor's Versions just fall flat to me, and it makes my enjoyment of them lessen. I'm really scared to see what happens with Speak Now TV because I just don't know if he can capture the emotions correctly. I would absolutely love if Nathan and Taylor worked together again, I really miss them. Also, the style of singing Taylor had on her first 4 albums is my preferred style, I'm not a huge fan of sing-talking, which a lot of Midnights is.

Aaron Dessner is also up there as a fave, he's made some great tracks and honestly, the 3 a.m. edition of Midnights is superior because of his influence. I'm glad that Taylor found him to work with and I can see their partnership continuing for many years.

Jack gets a lot of flack from Swifties and while I understand, I think some of it is undeserved. Jack is one of Taylor's best friends and she's never going to stop working with him. Also, people will criticize him yet in the same breath list some of his songs as their favorites, (Getaway Car, gold rush, OOTW, Cruel Summer, YOYOK are just a few of his songs and all fan favorites). I think the problem is that when there's *too* much Jack, all the songs kind of sound the same. I find he works best when he does some of the songs and not the entire album, or has a co-collaborator such as his work with Aaron. 

Max Martin and Shellback were superior in the pop arena, and not having Max has hurt the pop songs on Red, so I'm not sure how 1989 and reputation will sound. They're hitmakers for a reason, and I do enjoy their work with Taylor, although I understand why she was reluctant to work with Max given his requirement of having song writing credits.

I would love to see her work with Ryan Tedder and Imogen Heap again, I think they could make some great songs together again.",neutral

"I think that is how a rebound relationship is usually described.  But like I said, I‚Äôve never known a single rebound to be intentional.   The result is often the same, one is closer to being over the previous relationship and the other is hurt.   She called it off once the rebound was over and she realized he wasn‚Äôt the right guy.  If it were a true rebound and everyone on this thread agrees that it was, then it wasn‚Äôt intentional and she wasn‚Äôt using him.  And there is a difference.  Breaking up with someone and knowing they will be hurt, a normal person does feel sorry about that.  If that person was dangerously close to using someone, they don‚Äôt feel sorry, they feel guilt.  And I don‚Äôt get that from getaway car.  Either way, it‚Äôs just lyrics that shouldn‚Äôt be taken that literally.

So one day I was just so fed up with it,  I was wondering why I wasn't like a normal guy with normal weight and play football with other dudes. Like what's so wrong with me. I kept wishing to die so I wouldn't have to live like this. As I was having these thoughts, I was scrolling YouTube and I see this video I click on it and it's Love Story by Taylor Swift. At that point, I had no idea who she was especially as I'm not from USA. I'm watching the video and listening to the song, and I'm like WOW I wonder how that must feel like,  to be in love and running toward your lover and doing that whole turning around Taylor does when she meets Romeo at the climax of the song. I thought I can't give up on life when I haven't experienced anything yet. And so I was like I'm gonna keep going. Life is not all bad and there will be some good in it. And basically that was how I fell in love with Taylor and her music ‚ù§Ô∏è . It's the longest relationship ,if we can call it that, for me haha. I do have another friendship from that same year with a girl up to today and she always understood my love for Taylor. So that's the story. Years have gone by and so much has happened but that one moment will always be anchored in my mind. Maybe one day, I'll get to meet Taylor and tell her this. Just so she knows how much her music touched people all around the world. I'm also thankful for this community with whom I can share my passion  for Taylor's art.",neutral

"The text for those who are paywalled: 

‚ÄúThe singer‚Äôs performance of ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù on SNL was a bold reminder of how far she has come as an artist.

When Taylor Swift was only 22, she laid awake at night and worried about her age. That‚Äôs the confession the now-31-year-old singer makes on ‚ÄúNothing New,‚Äù a track she wrote for her 2012 album, Red, but only released on Red (Taylor‚Äôs Version), the new, rerecorded version that came out on Friday. In the song, she describes how society tells young women to have fun and then shames them for experiencing life. She wonders why she seems to lose confidence with each passing year. ‚ÄúLord, what will become of me,‚Äù she sings, ‚Äúonce I‚Äôve lost my novelty?‚Äù

Sad as it may seem, this was a fair question for a prodigy to have been asking. In pop, success is fleeting: Conventional wisdom says that an act‚Äôs ‚Äúimperial phase‚Äù‚Äîa career-defining hot streak‚Äîrarely lasts for more than a few years. Many women in the entertainment business can attest to the public‚Äôs limited appetite for ingenues who continue to evolve. When she was writing the original Red, Swift was already three hit albums into an astonishing career that began when she was just 16 years old. Even though she‚Äôd barely matured into drinking age, continued relevance wasn‚Äôt assured.
Swift‚Äôs latest project, rerecording her first six albums, not only demonstrates how impressively long her reign has turned out to be. It also is helping extend that reign while illuminating the secrets to her success. When in 2019 she announced her plan to recycle her own catalog to thwart a business rival, many observers suspected that the undertaking would be a minor diversion. Instead, it has been a dazzling victory lap that seems likely to inspire a whole new race. On Red (Taylor‚Äôs Version), her second rerelease, she continues to push herself to new places as she doubles down on the things that make her beloved. A walloping performance on Saturday Night Live last night showed exactly how she‚Äôs pulling that off.

Rather than following the playbook of singing two separate songs during the comedy show, she saved up her time for one tour de force: ‚ÄúAll Too Well (10 Minute Version).‚Äù A breakup ballad with an epic scope, the original ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù was a fan favorite on Red. For the rereleased album, Swift added on an extended cut that nearly doubles the original‚Äôs runtime. Sound like a bonus for only the most curious listeners? The track is a stunner, the ultimate Swift statement, and she has audaciously made it the centerpiece of the Red 2.0 rollout.


The original ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù told a story that was clear-cut and also richly layered: Swift‚Äôs narrator pines for the bygone bliss of a failed relationship. But in a late-song tonal swerve, she asserts that her ex can‚Äôt move on from her either‚Äîwhy else would he not return her scarf? ‚ÄúTime won‚Äôt fly; it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm paralyzed by it,‚Äù goes one line that helps summon the telescoping, time-travel feeling that defines so many of her best songs.
The new version intensifies that feeling. Fresh specifics emanate both warm nostalgia (there‚Äôs a vignette about childhood photos) and cooling disdain (no fans saw an ironic ‚Äúfuck the patriarchy‚Äù coming). Ready-to-borrow breakup bumper stickers abound (‚ÄúYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath‚Äù). Rather than clutter the song, this extra material mesmerizes as Swift‚Äôs cadence slips and slides against the steadily pounding beat. Late in the song, a tempo shift jolts the listener and helps the narrator zoom out from the story she‚Äôs told.
On SNL, Swift turned this improbably riveting song into improbably riveting TV. She likely didn‚Äôt even need to project the track‚Äôs music video‚Äîa literal dramatization of the lyrics, played by very good-looking people‚Äîbehind her to make it work. Maybe she didn‚Äôt need the autumn leaves falling from the rafters, but they were a nice touch. And though it helped that she graciously performed her celebrity-guest duties elsewhere during the episode (appearing in a musical sketch about ‚Äúthree sad virgins‚Äù), that wasn‚Äôt really what made her turn on SNL memorable.

The real appeal was Swift standing at a mic. As she moved through different phases of action‚Äîstill at the start, light headbanging in the middle, dreamy swaying at the end‚Äîshe created a sense of progression. Meanwhile, she used her eyes as an instrument by flicking her gaze into the camera to deliver the most damning lines, as if directly to her ex. Though her band was far away from her for most of the performance, two backup singers pulled up beside her for the chilling final refrain, cementing the feeling that an exorcism had been completed and Swift was ready to reenter the world.

Perhaps Swift could have pulled off a performance like this at age 22; she says she wrote the lyrics to this extended version back when she was first recording Red. But having the guts to sell the world on a 10-minute ballad about a scarf feels like the product of assurance that only comes with age. Swift‚Äôs power, you could see in this performance, lies in the way her ambition‚Äîas a songwriter and as a public figure‚Äîis served by her preternatural wisdom about time. She knows how it flows, and she knows how it feels, and it turns out she knows how to stop it for 10 minutes at once.‚Äù",neutral

OG was something everyone can relate to but the 10 min version is just so raw and about Taylor.

I was thrown back by the musical changes in the song but on the second listen and knowing that this/something along these lines was sung impromptu before rehearsal by Taylor makes me LOVE IT EVEN MORE. It sounds like she was not writing a song but just letting herself sing her feelings and because it was unplanned it changes its sounds so many times and ends so cathartically... it really feels like when you write a really emotional recap of your day and as you're reaching the end because you have let your emotions out, you are more mellow and sometimes repeating a question",neutral

"Hmmm.

Debut: **Tied Together With A Smile** just breaks my heart. *Hold on, baby, you're losing it.* It's such a moving expression of empathy for a friend who's struggling with self-image and self-love.

Fearless: **Breathe** is one of her best apology songs, and it's even sadder for the fact that it's so simply stated. *People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out*.  
Fearless TV: **We Were Happy** tears me up every time. He put his arm around her! They were gonna buy his daddy's farm! He was gonna marry her! *And we were happy.*

Speak Now: **Last Kiss** may actually be sadder than Dear John? I think Dear John is the correct track five choice, mind you, because it's more vulnerable and has more to say. But Last Kiss doesn't have that moment of triumphant ""actually I will overcome this"" at the end, just *you can plan for a change in the weather and time, but I never planned on you changing your mind*.

RED: **Sad Beautiful Tragic** plays out like a litany of despair. *Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting, silence, the train runs off the track*  
RED TV: **Ronan**. Is this a question? I can't talk about it, that's how sad it is. *No one knows what to say, about a beautiful boy who died.*

1989: **Wildest Dreams** sits in a strange place where I wouldn't categorize it as *sad*, exactly, but tbh I wouldn't categorize any of the songs on 1989 as *sad*, exactly. But certain lyrics definitely hit that mark: *I can see the end as it begins, my last request, it is:*

reputation: **Dancing With Our Hands Tied** again hits more at anxious than sad, but then again you've got lyrics like *I'd hold you as the water rushes in, if I could dance with you again*

Lover: **Soon You'll Get Better**. I can't talk about this. *What am I supposed to do, if there's no you?*

folklore: **this is me trying** is my pick but I could make an argument for about half the songs on here. *Pulled my car off the road to the lookout, could've followed my fears all the way down.* It's a perfect description of depression, burnout, and despair.

evermore: **happiness** is again the winner by a narrow margin. *In the disbelief, I can't face reinvention; I haven't met the new me yet* but again I could make an argument for about half the tracklist.",neutral

When we finally got drunk enough to kiss in public in a crowded bar they were all cheering and laughing, just being drunk and rowdy.  It really reminds me of that.  Not like I think everyone was so obsessed with us, it‚Äôs just the kind of fun silly behavior of your teens and 20s.

"I get it. I'm a cat person, and people who say they hate cats... I can't say this without cussing... they creep me the fuck out. I will never date a guy who says he hates cats, even though, honestly... most of those guys? They've honestly just never been around a cat and just don't know what they're like, and they'd probably like cats if they'd have an open mind because what they think cats are like... are not really how cats actually are. (I know this because used to talk to some of those guys on dating apps, but then I realized, why? I'd pick my cat over anybody any day of the week!)

I also used to be teased for liking Hanson in middle school. I was 11 when this started. I'm used to being made fun of for liking a band. I still get it 26 years later. People are shocked that they don't make the same songs like they did when they were kids and that they made their own independent label and they sell-out shows and they're successful. And when I play one of their songs for them, most of them quietly mumble, ""Yeah, that's pretty good. I was wrong."" Or some semblance of that. Some of them still don't like their music. But they stopped being in the spotlight 26 years ago, so it's a little different. People are okay with admitting they're wrong now, but they weren't okay with admitting it in 1997. Because a lot of people think it's cool to not like what's cool. (I was this way in high school. It DOESN'T make you cool. It makes you INCREDIBLY lame.)

And that's probably what they'll do with Taylor when she's not in the spotlight anymore. A lot of the people that don't like her now will suddenly admit her music is good. But there will still be a lot of people that just don't like her music because it's not their taste, and that's okay.",neutral

It's not just because of Covid actually. The demand for vinyl has increased immensely yet there is no plans to build new plants. Now 3-5 month wait is normal. You can read more [here](https://superdeluxeedition.com/feature/a-pressing-issue-how-the-vinyl-revival-has-caught-out-the-music-industry-during-the-pandemic/). The good news is that I'm guessing one of the reasons Red is coming so long after Fearless is because she is waiting for vinyl to be ready to ship at launch this time around. I'm basing this on the fact that in an interview from last November with rolling stone she alluded she was in the middle of re-recording red so my guess is that the record has been done for a while which means they were probably able to send it for pressing a while ago so vinyl will be ready in November and now they're just waiting for Fearless vinyl to ship before opening pre sales for Red,neutral
"I totally agree with what other people were saying, but I also think she needs to own her own music so that she can choose if/when to perform it. I think that this is probably one of the main reasons for rerecording, so that she can continue to preform her old music. 

And even though she doesn't own her old masters, she still makes money from it being streamed, so even though some of the money is going to Scooter, a lot is probably going to her too. 

Also, I feel like the rerecording process as a whole is really cementing her reputation as a musical icon. New generations of swifties get to fall in love with her back catalogue and everyone gets to appreciate her older music.",neutral

"I love some songs now and I know a few of them will permanently be on my playlist, but that initial disappointment of this being a full pop album instead of another Dessner project or even a new pop rock sound as hinted by the photoshoot‚Ä¶ yeah, I haven‚Äôt gotten over that yet. Because she never went back to a genre once she left it (TVs don‚Äôt count), it was bizarre to me.

And then my issue is with the production itself. Most of the songs sound unfinished, like there‚Äôs still a piece or two or even three missing. I‚Äôve listened to instrumental versions of the songs and they‚Äôre mostly so repetitive to the point of annoyance - it wasn‚Äôt like that with her other full pop albums (1989, Rep, Lover). 

There‚Äôs no very impressive bridge and there‚Äôs no soaring feeling in any of these songs. It‚Äôs very much felt. 

We know she‚Äôs a brilliant songwriter and we know what she‚Äôs capable of, that‚Äôs never in doubt, but lyrically this is a total step back from her folk era. My one issue being there‚Äôs one or two lines that are so perfect but they don‚Äôt fit in the song or deserve better songs to be in. Or lines that are too long they don‚Äôt make sense melodically - Question‚Ä¶? being the biggest offender here. Narratively some songs are also messy - again with Question‚Ä¶? being the biggest offender.

"As a feminist who is also white (and trying my best to re-educate myself so that I can be a helpful ally to women of color), I think it's important to acknowledge that Taylor has made some classic White Feminist‚Ñ¢ mistakes. That critique isn't coming out of nowhere. And I think it's important for us (as fans, as intersectional feminists) to recognize these mistakes so that we 1) don't make them ourselves, and 2) can hold our faves accountable to values they claim to hold dear (for example, not being racist, which is pretty much the bare minimum imo). I've noticed in conversations I've had about TS and white feminism that two major incidents tend to come up:

*Taylor and Nicki Minaj's brief 2015 Twitter feud.* ([Full run-down here.](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6641794/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-twitter-argument-timeline)) Bad Blood and Anaconda were both up for MTV VMAs the same year. Anaconda was noticeably absent from the video of the year nominations, despite being a massively popular video that broke records, while Bad Blood got nominated. Nicki tweeted her discontent for the snub, noting how it quite possibly would have been nominated if she and the other women in the video were skinny and white. Her frustration was clearly at the institutional racism in the VMA nomination/awards process, but Taylor made a classic White Feminist‚Ñ¢ mistake and took the criticism like a subtweet at her (and her video predominantly full of skinny white women) and instead places the blame on men getting nominated in Nicki's place. The misstep here is that Taylor derailed a conversation about institutional racism, and centered it around herself instead. (She also centered sexism *rather than* racism in her response, when this issue is clearly a mix of both. This is the trademark of White Feminism, not acknowledging that these systems of oppression intersect and impact women of color *at the same time*.) The internet then latched onto a Nicki vs. Taylor stan war for a sec, further pulling away from the actual issues at-hand. After realizing that she had misread the situation, Taylor did publicly apologize to Nicki on Twitter and, as you can hear from Nicki [in this short video](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/nicki-minaj-addresses-firestorm-mtvs-video-music-awards-32660212), apologized again and had a conversation with her in private. It seems like the apology was genuine and accepted, and everyone was able to move on. 

*The Wildest Dreams music video*. This video glamorizes an Old Hollywood aesthetic (which was a time and place that was extremely overtly racist), in a way that Old Hollywood was very overtly racist: the white imperialist African fantasy. If you're not at all familiar with film history, there was a very large span of time where it was trendy for Hollywood to glamorize the ""exotic"" settings of (largely) Asia and Africa through the lens of a ""civilized"" (ew) all-white cast of characters. This mirrored and promoted European imperialism across the world, which has lead to a ton of racist oppression that we can still see the effects of today. So making this video about white movie stars in the '50s on the set of a movie like this, without including Black people in the cast, or giving any indication that this is some kind of alternate history/sci-fi utopia timeline, looks like it just perpetuates/glamorizes this explicitly racist aspect of Hollywood history. Many critics have given varying [degrees of disdain](https://jezebel.com/director-says-taylor-swifts-wildest-dreams-video-cant-b-1728284913) for this video. Now, Taylor didn't direct the video, but she would have had to give the concept her approval. And director Joseph Kahn [tried to rationalize his decision](https://www.insider.com/joseph-kahn-wildest-dreams-taylor-swift-music-video-no-black-whitewashed-2017-11) to not include Black actors on-screen, but honestly it seems like it just would've been better to use a different concept. [Lauretta Charlton at Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/2015/09/take-a-breather-wildest-dreams-isnt-racist.html) wrote an article giving the creative team the benefit of the doubt, writing that:

&gt;\[the video\] is, at best, an inadvertent racial microaggression, one of those tiny but loaded infractions committed by individuals in positions of  power. A single microaggression often goes unnoticed, but taken as a  whole, they fill the cracks at the bedrock of our collective prejudice, making it stronger, more durable, and harder to dismantle.

It was a bad music video. And Taylor never responded to its criticism (and she probably should have). But like Charlton notes in her article, the racist implications of the video don't seem intentional. It seems like the non-Black creative team just didn't realize that the concept inherently carries a lot of negative baggage that is still harmful to many people today. Lover era to present, I've noticed that the casting of Taylor's music videos has been much more racially diverse than it used to be. I don't know how much of that has been Taylor's doing, but it does show tentative signs of progressing past this mistake.

TL;DR, Taylor Swift isn't an ""unproblematic fave."" She's a human with flaws, and has been guilty of ignorant white feminist mistakes. Ultimately, if your friend-of-a-friend doesn't feel like her actions align with his ideals or the standards he upholds for the artists he follows, it's okay if he doesn't want to listen to her. And it's okay that we continue to be fans of hers, but we should be aware of her faults in social justice matters so that we can identify when we are also being bad allies. For further reading, I'd recommend this short article, [""Admit It: Your Fave Is Problematic"" by Ijeoma Oluo](https://medium.com/matter/admit-it-your-fave-is-problematic-2dfa692f557b).",neutral

"It was actually Look What You Made Me Do... I grew up  liking dance-pop artists such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna, and Taylor was known for her singer-songwriter / country style which I wasn't interested in, so I never gave her music a chance. Until I listened to LWYMMD when it came out and I really liked it (I guess it was one of her more uptempo songs which may have been a reason why). From there I bought Reputation when it came out and I really liked it, and went to the Rep tour (for both Taylor and Camila Cabello because I was a fan of her music at the time).

Over the next year, I bought her older music, which was wonderful as I began to develop my music taste past dance music. Now my favourite records of Taylor's would be Red, 1989, Folklore and Evermore. I find it intriguing that she's one of my favourite artists now despite me not liking her music as a kid, though I appreciate the fact that she's an artist whose music has become an important part of my teenage years.",neutral

- They worked on the design with Taylor‚Äôs team (who know exactly what response they‚Äôll get from 13 purple stars, tons more social engagement)

- we‚Äôll find out what her RSD release is next month

‚Äî‚Äî

Colliton has what may be slightly disappointing news for the fans who think they‚Äôve figured out the DaVinci Code: It was her team that put together that graphic, not Swift‚Äôs.

So you‚Äôd be better off betting against ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù turning out to be her RSD titled. Everyone will find out in about a month, anyway, when Swift‚Äôs RSD item is unveiled along with the rest of the hundreds of exclusives.

‚ÄúHoly cow, the conspiracy theories have been so much fun today,‚Äù Colliton laughs. ‚ÄúThere is a release. I can‚Äôt confirm or deny if it is what I think what they think it is. But there are absolutely zero clues about the release in that. There may be meaning (about Swift generally), but not clues. But I would be lying if I said that coming up with that seal and working with her team on it wasn‚Äôt part of the fun, knowing that everybody picks apart every little thing associated with Taylor.‚Äù Anyway, ‚ÄúIn this case, I feel pretty confident in knowing that what they‚Äôre saying is not the case.

"You weren't doing this, but I see a lot of people dismiss Evermore as Folklore B-sides so I try to clarify that the Evermore songs came after Folklore.  I think it shows up in the songs.  Folklore is emotionally Taylor writing about her masters for the first time.  The first Folklore song written  was My Tears Ricochet.  And then the first months of the pandemic when the future was completely unknown. 

Evermore was written in late summer and fall of 2020 after there was more clarity on the new normal with the pandemic, but it was over the 4 year anniversaries of the significant events from 2016 in her life.   It was also another presidential election year just like 2016 so bringing back some of the same emotions.  So a lot of the Evermore is Taylor emotionally reprocessing the events from 2016 with additional perspective.",neutral

she wrote a fair number of songs in 2012. Including after meeting him at the KCA. I'm not saying definitively that they dated then (I don't know obviously) but it's possible they were ""dating"" or seeing each other casually or heck maybe Taylor just had a crush. I wasn't even trying to comment on OP specifically, I was just agreeing with the original commenter that I think her and Harry could've been involved in a flirty/romantic way sooner than the GP/media thinks and thus inspired songs.

"For reaaaal like have people even watched the early performances, some of them are vocally very rough. The reviewer even says she showed promise at a different show but didn‚Äôt live up to it here. I don‚Äôt think this reviewer would regret their review at all, she probably wasn‚Äôt very good at this particular show.",neutral
"It‚Äôs the best possible length when considering multiple factors: amount of catalog to perform, time people can endure, and time a performer can endure (especially for long-term health). 

Personally, a 3hr concert would be reaching my peak of personal endurance for how much time I can spend in a loud, crowded environment (because it‚Äôs Taylor, it would be longer than other situations). But even 3 hours is pushing it. But I can‚Äôt imagine her being able to do ANYTHING in a shorter amount of time. I think her best option is to heavily feature the albums that don‚Äôt have solo tours: Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights. Debut got a lot of playtime as a featured songs pack in other shows, so there isn‚Äôt much need to stress it. But the other albums barely got any performance time. So I think she could perform mostly mashups of singles and most beloved songs from the first 6 eras, then pull complete songs of the same caliber (maybe one or two rare gems) from the rest of the album. Lover and Evermore need to be the biggest focus, I feel, because they barely got any performances. And Midnights will of course be her most recent album, so she‚Äôll need to do a heavy dose of that to close out. Folklore isn‚Äôt in such dire straits, because there‚Äôs the acoustic concert movie on Disney. And honestly, there‚Äôs not much you can do to zjuzj up a mostly acoustic record. Lover and Midnights will benefit most from big loud presentation, while folklore and evermore can serve as guitar and piano pieces to bring things down. 

In terms of practicality, performing mostly singles will be the best route. They‚Äôre songs everyone knows and most easily associated with an era. And if she performs mashups of singles, she can condense the most popular songs into their most recognizable sound bites while saving time for her more under appreciated (but crucial) songs. But I‚Äôd be so disappointed if there weren‚Äôt a handful of deep cuts or rare fan faves. Personally, I hope she doesn‚Äôt perform ATWTMV, because we‚Äôve gotten a few performances of that as it is and a short film, and in terms of time, it will take up a huge chunk by itself. I know people may be disappointed, but it‚Äôs going to be a waste when there are nearly 200 other songs to perform, most of which didn‚Äôt get SNL or award ceremony performances. 

Side note: Long Live will be the perfect song to close out on.",neutral

"The for me is supposed to rhyme with injury. And make the two lines closer to having the same number of syllables. 


I can see you standing honey (8 syllables)  
Like he‚Äôs just your understudy  (9)  
Like you‚Äôd get your knuckles bloody for me (10) 

Second third and hundredth chances (8)  
Balancing on breaking branches (8)  
Those eyes add insult to injury (9) 

If she left it off she would have a rhyme for understudy (which she does with bloody anyway) but no rhyme for ‚Äúfor me‚Äù 

I can see you standing honey  (8)
Like he‚Äôs just you‚Äôre understudy (8)  
Like you‚Äôd get your knuckles bloody  (8)

Second third and hundredth chances (8)  
Balancing on breaking branches (8)  
Those eyes add insult to injury (9) 

So if it ended at bloody having 3 lines with perfect syllable matches in a row ending with a rhyming couplet (which indicates a complete thought) would sort of in a sense ‚Äúuse up‚Äù those words and syllables and leave ‚Äúinjury‚Äù without anything to tie back to. 

Because the rhyme she‚Äôs making is ‚Äúfor me‚Äù to the  
 ‚Äúju-ry‚Äù part of ‚Äúinjury‚Äù not just the ‚Äúee‚Äù sounding ending of the word but also the ‚Äúur‚Äù sounding ‚Äúr‚Äù phonic. 

And because the ‚Äúf‚Äù sound and the ‚Äúj‚Äù sound are both made in a way that similarly forces air audibly through you lips (make the sounds and compare the way the air sounds for those letters as compared to when you make for example an ‚ÄúL‚Äù sound or a ‚ÄúN‚Äù or ‚ÄúY‚Äù sound) that makes the ‚Äúfuh‚Äù of the ‚Äúf‚Äù sound in ‚Äúfor me‚Äù rhyme with the ‚Äújuh‚Äù of the ‚Äúj‚Äùsound in ‚Äúinjury) 

(And of course the line also has the assonance of ‚ÄúINsult to INjury‚Äù to make sure the ‚Äúin‚Äù sound in ‚Äúinjury‚Äù isn‚Äôt left hanging. 


Without the ‚Äúfor me‚Äù you‚Äôd have to changing the ‚Äúinsult to to injury‚Äù (and lose the assonance of the ‚Äúin‚Äù sounds) line to something that ended like bloody with an   
‚Äúuh-dƒì‚Äù sound as well as trim the line down to also be 8 syllables because an 8,8,8, 8,8,9 syllable scheme for and A,A,A  B,B,A rhyme scheme doesn‚Äôt work rhythmically.

"Agreed with everything except the lavender haze = being in love in this MV

I know she's said the song is about that specifically but during this whole video she seems... not blissfully in love? The lavender haze seems to happen when she's alone/without him? Idk it also seemed to me like she was only acting like things were fine with her man while her friends were taking pictures/videos/at a party.

It'd be easier to dismiss if this had been directed by someone else but she's clearly building the narrative here and the video seems to contradict what the song is about... I wonder if that means something is amiss and she's trying to shy away from the 'so blissfully in love' theme? Or if it was all a ruse to begin with? Or maybe it is just about weed and wanting to NGAF...

"Okay okay, this is a long shot. But I want to share this and hear other peoples opinions. On March 14th 2019, Taylor made a post referencing butterfly migration. While that was hinting at the Lover Era, it seems as though butterflies have come back into the picture with Ed Sheeran‚Äôs album. The butterfly that is connected to the song that Taylor is featured on is the 5th one counting from left to right from the top. There has been a lot of speculation about the number 5. I also noticed that there are *10* full hearts. Taylor has only released 9 albums, but could that mean that 10 albums are completed? There is also one empty heart, which I thought was interesting. Back to the March 14th date and why I think it‚Äôs important. When discussing the Red TV, Taylor made a comment about giving clues 3 years in advance.. but why would she mention that now? People might forget or be hyper focused on everything she says and does. BUT. What if she was giving some insight to clues she has already left behind? Three years from March 14th, 2019 is March 14th, 2022. I think she mentioned it recently to give us a clue of what she has already done. Also, there is a tweet shared by Ed Sheeran with art for his new album.. it has 14 butterflies.",neutral

"Hang in there friend ‚ù§Ô∏è I feel the same way about this release. For some reason it just feels‚Ä¶ different. I was over the moon about folklore and evermore as well. I think this feels different because Taylor and her team has done some weird stuff this year (the countdown on May 13, Amsterdam movie, the four ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù vinyls, etc..) That along with her silence about the re-recordings. We were so focused on Speak Now or 1989 coming next, that this feels like a plot twist. Also we have no idea what this album is going to sound like! We have very little info about the album except when it‚Äôs coming out and what the aesthetic will look like.
For me, the older I get, the harder it is for me to understand why Taylor chooses to remain so secretive about her albums until they are released. Sometimes it‚Äôs really fun, and sometimes it just feels a bit weird. And I love this woman to death! I walked down the aisle to Love Story when I got married and I too was in the 0.5% of her listeners on Spotify. I‚Äôve had to remind myself that Taylor too is just human and sometimes she will disappoint me. And that is okay! Taking a walk with my favorite latte and listening to Folklore or All too Well 10 minutes really helps me when I am feeling sad/depressed. I don‚Äôt think there is anything a walk can‚Äôt fix! Making my favorite comfort meal and cookies, going to the bookstore to buy a new book, re-watching Gilmore Girls, and surrounding myself with people I love, really helps me when I‚Äôm feeling depressed.

"&gt;there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs not an autobiographical song

She confirmed it is not in an interview with EW:

&gt;I think I was writing from three different characters' perspectives, one who's going through that; I was channeling the emotions I was feeling in 2016, 2017, where I just felt like I was worth absolutely nothing. And then, the second verse is about dealing with addiction and issues with struggling every day. And every second of the day, you're trying not to fall into old patterns, and nobody around you can see that, and no one gives you credit for it.

--

She also confirms it's about mental health and addiction during the long pond sessions:


&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking about people who, if they‚Äôre suffering from mental illness, or addiction, or have an every day struggle, no one pats them on the back every day but every day they are actively fighting something.  Somebody like that must want everyone to know how hard it is for them, but you only know for yourself that you're trying your best.

&gt;The first verse is about someone who's in a life crisis, who has been trying and failing and it has been ruining relationships, they keep dissapointing everyone. They have driven to a cliff and could end it all, but chose to drive back home. Not driving off the cliff is the act of trying.

&gt;The second verse is about someone who felt like they had a lot of potential, but lost in life. They start drinking, but try not to every second.",neutral

"i first started listening to ts ironically, kind of a joke thing, being a rock/metal fan mostly, but quickly turned to a fan when 1989 came out. style is still one of my top three ts songs and one of the best songs to go on a night drives and listen to.

i always liked her stripped down performances where she sits down and does a song with an acoustic guitar, so folklore eventually solidified her as one of the best artists on my favorites list with stripped down production and glorious songwriting and folkore actually pretty much saved me when i was at the lowest point of my life, i replayed that album endlessly. 

how do i deal with others teasing me? i shrug it off, laugh about it, what i do like tho, is the people that come to me eventually and say ""you know what? i've been listening to ts lately because of you and gotta say she's actually pretty decent"". well, no shit.",neutral

2. Yes, I‚Äôve collected all the OG albums and the re-recordings.
  
3. Yes, I have collected (and plan to continue to) all variants that are part of the standard release. For Midnights, I have preordered all 5 variants (so far). I am not collecting any RSDs. The only exception was with evermore: I REALLY wanted the opaque variant. I was stupid and cancelled my preorder for evermore that would gotten me an opaque record, so I ordered some from the Canadian store with the hope that they were opaque- they were not! Ironically, I placed another order from the US store, and I probably got one of the last opaque records from that batch.
  
4. When I was collecting the OG records, I found online records stores from Discogs. I spent a lot of time searching random record stores across the country, but I finally completed my collection. I was also fortunate to find a few of the OG records for a good price on Amazon (and sold by Amazon). 
  
5. Yes, I always buy the Target variants - even the AWFUL red folklore record. bleh

Unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt think lover fest ticket holders should‚Äôve been prioritized. It‚Äôs been years and it‚Äôs a whole new show.

"You‚Äôre right.  Reputation needed to happen to show how 2016-2017 affected her emotionally. But Lover was just as important as a palate cleanser.  More so then any other album Lover needed to change narrative about who she was and to set the parameters for her future. Me! And YNTCD get a lot of hate but they needed to be the first two singles in order to shake off the dark motifs of Reputation while at same time make sure the press stop including her personal life in the narrative.   

As you said Cruel Summer, Cornelia Street, Archer, and I Forgot That You Exist would have had the press reporting on how she can‚Äôt get over a grudge and won‚Äôt stop playing the victim if they were early singles. And the pink/purple tie dye aesthetic wouldn‚Äôt have worked.  And on flip side if she would have done Paper Rings or London Boy as singles, it would have been all about her personal life.  Would have been interesting to see what the rest of the singles would have been if the tour had happened because I suspect at least Cruel Summer would have been a single and probably at least one more. 

With Lover setting the narrative that she is going to protective her private life fiercely it was a natural transition to doing songs that told other people‚Äôs stories. Without Lover‚Äôs press cycle and Miss Americana shutting done the press‚Äôs obsession with her love life, folklore might not have been received as well

Reputation to Lover to Folklore has been such an important transition for to change her image and make her life enjoyable. Now all but the worst haters are starting to acknowledge that she belongs in the same sentence with people like the Beatles, Madonna and Michael Jackson.",neutral

Watch the music videos! There‚Äôs playists on YouTube of them and they‚Äôre all so great. 

Watch the making of and behind the scenes videos for reputation, Lover, 1989, Red, etc (just search ‚ÄúTaylor Swift behind the scenes on youtube)


Watch Taylor‚Äôs ‚Äúmonologue song‚Äù from SNL in like, 2009

‚ÄúTaylor Swift performances‚Äù 

‚ÄúTaylor Swift cats‚Äù 

‚ÄúTaylor Swift funny‚Äù (her sense of humor is my favorite thing about her) 

‚ÄúTaylor Swift Songwriting‚Äù 

Look up the Liner Notes for each album (and the reputations prologue and the two reputation poems) as well as the secret messages for every album through 1989. 

Go to this website to see all of her magazine covers and features https://www.taylorswiftweb.net/category/magazines/

Some basic trivia:
the names of her cats and who they‚Äôre named after (Olivia Benson, Meredith Grey, and Benjamin Button)

know her favorite number is 13, 

during the fearless era she had her mom draw a 13 on her hand for every performance. 

During the speak now era she wrote a different song lyric by another artist on her arm for every show. here is a link to a playlist of all the songs the lyrics were from https://open.spotify.com/user/brian_mansfield/playlist/1sJLWFWLBPhospLARs67E6?si=MMJSByoHQjGpva5EjgikiQ&amp;dl_branch=1

Check out the non-album songs like, Sweeter Than Fiction (the first song Jack Antonoff ever produced) Eyes Open and Safe and Sound, I Don‚Äôt Wanna Live Forever, and the songs she gave to other people like This Is What You Came For, Babe, and Better Man. 

If you are interested in unreleased songs I have a folder link I can share if you DM me. 

Know about fan things like ‚Äúthere were 5 holes in the fence‚Äù, and ‚Äú1,2,3 Let‚Äôs Go Bitch!‚Äù 

Do yourself a favor and learn the song acronyms. That way you can easily read something like: TIWWCHNT, DWOHT, IKYWT, WANEGBT, AYHTDWS, tlgad , ttds, KOMH, IFTYE, DBATC, INTHAF, ITHK, MAATHP, IKP, WTNY, etc. (This Is Why We Can‚Äôt Have Nice Things, Dancing With Our Hands Tied, I Knew You Were Trouble, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, All You Had To Do Was Stay, the last great american dynasty, tis the damn season, King Of My Heart, I Forgot That You Existed, Death By A Thousand Cuts, It‚Äôs Nice To Have A Friend, Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince, I Know Places, Welcome To New York) 

My last bit of advice is just follow a few fan accounts with good trivia and videos on insta because that way you can open your explore page and always have interesting Taylor content to waste way too much time scrolling through when you should be working or studying. 

Also don‚Äôt feel like you have to do or watch or learn everything all at once (or ever)! Just pick what appeals to you! It‚Äôs a gradual process and all it takes to be a swiftie is to love Taylor‚Äôs music! Hope this helps! Welcome to the best fandom in existence!",neutral

"""They'd say I hustled, put in the work

It's all the same- these people feel superiority because they listen to 'real music' lol, not a woman liked by teenage girls. The Beatles were perceived the same way in the beginning but it was easier for people to take them seriously later on because among other things- they're men! And Taylor being an anomalous talent that got to the top of the ladder without being manufactured by some label really hurts their ego. It's all a way to save their egos. Who's gonna tell them that Taylor literally came from an indie label (despite all the ways they wanna twist the narrative about her dad having enough belief in talent and determination to invest in her future) that didn't even have enough revenue to launch her internationally on her first two albums at first(hence the Fearless international version). She didn't work with any big-timer producer but gave a chance to someone who had never produced an album before. She literally put in the work to go for a 6 month radio tour while in high school so that she can achieve her dreams. That work ethic is as important as having talent, but no, how can Taylor Swift have either of those things?",neutral

"The album being ""things that keep me up at night"" I'm glad it wasn't all cutesy/or GF ""sexy"". To me the song it isn't a song about ""being so in love"", it's a song about being under intense public scrutiny while being in love- the ""Are you ever getting married?"" times 1,000. To me it's almost like a dream where she's running to avoid all the public drama associated with her love life. The fear of letting ""your image"" or ""your brand"" make the most important decision of your life and consume the personal ""you"". (Yes, I'm paraphrasing her.) The mocking of celebrity private relationships being treated as public domain- I love. ""Damned if I do give a damn what people say""

 ""I've been under scrutiny yeah oh yeah all this sht is new to me but you handle it beautifully""...

""Talk your sht and go viral I just need this love spiral, get it off your chest, get it off my desk"" is when she COULD ""break free"", (yes I saw the visual effect) but a lovey dovey Taylor can be seen in A LOT of her videos, so I'm not bothered by it. Lavender Haze doesn't scream love song to me although ""being in love"" is the springboard. I'm not a huge fan of the video (as of now), but the tone and facial expressions don't seem ""weirdly off"" to me. Lyrically and rhythmically there's a lot of defiance of expectations and contempt for ""the 1950s shit they want from me"". Regardless I've seen Taylor act like she's in love in countless videos, so I think it was an artistic choice. Some people don't like that choice- which is fine. This video is practically split down the middle. Maybe going too hard for an anti-commercial sugarpop vibe? IDK.",neutral

"Why are so many people assuming that she cheated? To me the timelines never really equated to her cheating at all. Her and Calvin‚Äôs breakup was REPORTED in June, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs when it ended. Most likely, things ended between them weeks before. I also think it‚Äôs pretty clear that they were just about at the end well before they officially broke up and that they were both checked out of the relationship. That‚Äôs why people think she got with Tom right away but in reality it was most likely a case of Calvin and Taylor pretty much being done and it just not getting out to the public right away.

As for where Joe fits in, nothing we‚Äôve seen or read indicates they got together right away. I think she was into him when they first met but figured nothing would come of it besides being friends so they kept that up and she got with Tom, and her and a Joe just stayed long distance friends (pretty sure it was said that they would text and play games on their phones together). Then when Tom and Taylor ended, her and Joe had a chance to get together and they took it.

Basically, the Calvin and Taylor situation was messy at the end and I think it‚Äôs led people to not see the clear picture of what was probably going on. Tom was also clearly a rebound which I guess people can have an issue with, but I don‚Äôt see Taylor going to him a few weeks after ending things with Calvin as a sign of cheating.",neutral

"I love your analysis; it's so thorough and well-thought-out! The Archer is definitely one of my all-time favorites because I could relate to it in many different ways, like cutting off my own nose to spite my face because I've developed a binge-eating habit through college that has terribly affected my self-esteem and made the problem worse. I was also getting involved with guys that would put me on this pedestal but at the same time would treat me with disrespect, like I was just a trophy to them. I wound up hating myself because I was playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes and I didn't know how to break the cycle.

My turning point was falling in love with my best friend, who I've been with for almost 7 months now. He's been a huge help as far as my self-esteem, battling my disordered eating habits in healthy and productive ways, and ultimately treating me with equal respect and putting 100%  into our relationship.

I love how Taylor writes songs that are so personal and yet so universal to the struggles and triumphs that we all experience. It's what sets her apart from so many other artists. Like you pointed out, she shows how self-aware she's become in The Archer because she recognizes her own destructive behavior and asks her new love to stay and help her fight that part of herself and grow into a better person. I also interpret the song as her recognition of her arrested development because she became incredibly famous at a young age and was therefore kept from meeting certain emotional and mental milestones because her lifestyle didn't allow for normal adult relationships for the most part. Every little thing about her is broadcast to the world, so having a real private life with genuine friendships and romantic relationships has been very difficult for her. The ending of the song conveys to me that she's armed and ready to take on the world and live her life on her own terms with her new love, celebrity status be damned.",neutral

"Gotta say, I SLIGHTLY prefer the OG one. The OG's vocals have more of that longing/yearning tone that fits perfectly in with what the lyrics are talking about. What I like about the TV though, is that the vocals are clearly stronger (especially in the bridge), the background vocals are harmonized better, and the beat hits a little harder. So, it's almost a tie.

Also...one reeeeaaalllly minor complaint about TV vs. OG. It's at the very end of each song. The OG has the ""aaaahhhh"" background vocals fade into a distorted echo type of thing, which to me, REALLY adds a nice flair to the song and sounds so nice to listen to somehow. TV doesn't have that. Just throwing that out there.",neutral

Less important to me are the little details that are tougher to notice, but make you think ""man, it's a little dishonest how this album is billed as a product of one star but there's a ton of co-writers,"" or ""jeez, that guitar solo sounds *hard to play,*"" or ""she's using the same chords on all of her songs, are those the only ones she knows?"" Or ""just imagining singing that not makes my throat hurt."" If I notice something that reflects well on an artist on a song I like, I'll add that into reasons I think they're a ""cool"" artist. If I notice something not-so-good about them, it'll take away from it a little but I won't really notice it while listening.

All that being said, I'd love if her and other pop writers mixed up the chord progressions a bit more. Rick Beato recently had a video on this and those repetitive progressions do limit you a bit when you're figuring out melodies too.",neutral

"I absolutely did not know Mariah Carey wrote her own songs. I guess I was guilty of absorbing the propaganda about her that Taylor has been fighting. I just assumed she was a voice and a pretty face and a classic diva.

I actually don't like her music very much but that is no excuse.",sexism
"She embodies the angry parts of herself (A healthy thing). Her music is assertive and bold. I really respect that about her music.

However, in the same way that embodied sadness is stigmatised strongly in men, embodied anger in women is stigmatised strongly.

Further, as embodied anger is strongly correlated with power, there is the added element that a woman with embodied anger disrupts traditional patriarchal power structures. I believe the consequence is that men feel threatened, as well as women with internalised shame.

And, I believe this is what attracts male disdain and disrespect.",sexism

"I feel pretty confident she didn't just straight-up steal it. It's like the tenth best line in that song, so why would she? It's more common than you might think for artists to subconsciously remember lyrics and melodies from songs they've heard in the past, and use them without realizing.

It's also possible, though less likely, that it's a coincidence - she was familiar with at least one of Nathanson's other songs, since she wrote a lyric from it on her arm on the Speak Now tour, but it's not a guarantee that she knows this particular song. It's not the most creative or original lyric in the world (it's obv a v good line, just not especially innovative), so it's not unthinkable that two artists who write about similar themes of love and romance would both have the same idea.",neutral

I disagree. For me personally bejeweled (and question‚Ä¶?) is terrible and not at all cohesive. Like she wrote a bunch of thoughts and feelings about the situation and just strung it together best she could.

The thing about Joe is that he's still a barely known actor to the general public, he's not well known; and his partner is one of the most famous not just musicians but *people* in the entire world, the imbalance in fame is huge.

It was so infuriating how they made him seem like this small boy being taking over by this evil witch putting a spell on him. He was a fine adult and knew exactly who Taylor is and what kind of attention comes regarding her relationship. In fact there was rumours that he wanted to be public about their relationship more than Taylor. There were even rumors that he wanted her to walk red carpets with him. Either way, it just felt so strange to me that women themselves were doing this to Taylor. Sometimes it's true that women's biggest enemies could be other women themselves. Like the condescending way Tom's fans kept attacking Taylor's intelligence just because Tom in their minds has advanced education and not her. I kid you not they were saying she only graduated highschool what he could possibly talk to her about...... Anyway, we know Taylor isn't innocent perfect angel but at the same time the crap that gets thrown at her is absolutely ridiculous. Sorry for this long rant, but I'm so glad she's with Joe who's a private person and doesn't have ridiculous fans (although in this situation it's some swifties that are the problem but that's another story for another day).",sexism

1. I noticed our about me section has a photo with blue words cut off on the top left. I don‚Äôt know if this was there before or not, when you click it there is a blue circle https://imgur.com/a/2RXWjE5 I was able to find a google image with the picture back to December

2. This picture https://imgur.com/a/ZUpHEn7 (apparently added to the cardigan music video thumbnail on July 23, 2020, I don‚Äôt think this date is right?) is eerily similar to her first Not a lot going on at the moment picture https://imgur.com/a/DumMd0Q (uploaded April 27)

3. Taylor nation tweets the red wine picture on august 28, 2020 with THREE wine emojis https://imgur.com/a/DMm8L8p

4. On November 28, 2020 Taylor posts the next ‚Äúnot a lot going on at the moment photo‚Äù https://imgur.com/a/RyqMbjp then releases evermore a few weeks later

I think the red wine pic from july/august was her evermore post for ‚Äúnot a lot going on at the moment‚Äù. When the willow music video ‚Äúnot a lot going on at the moment‚Äù post was made she was already mostly done with evermore. It‚Äôs possible this is when she decided to do a third since she just kept writing.

5. This one just confuses me because I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else mention it. There are ten super subtle crescent moons in this picture, Taylor reposted it saying thank you with three emojis https://imgur.com/a/TpNaNLU

6. The moons above are not across the entire wallpaper. In this post there‚Äôs only two (faint on the right above her shoulder) https://imgur.com/a/ib2oHWW this is also a post for one of the THREE willow remixes

7. This is the third post for the third willow remix, there is an obvious single moon https://imgur.com/a/ORLjhFI

Now you could argue that a good lead single only increases hype towards a new project and raises awareness for the new album which is a good point unless it's a ME!.

"I wouldn't say that I stopped being a fan, but there were 2 instances when I can't fully vibe with her music. The first one was during the Lover era. I did not like the initial singles (Me!, YNTCD) because it felt like her lyricism regressed, and some of the songs sound (or feel) similar to one another (e.g. Daylight, Afterglow). There are some songs I really liked though (e.g. Cruel Summer, False God).

The second instance was Evermore. While I like Champagne Problems and Evermore and the lyricism of all of the songs are topnotch, they weren't as catchy as the songs in her previous albums. With the other albums, it's easy for me to memorize the lyrics by simply listening to the songs, but with Evermore, I can't seem to remember the words nor the melody. I like singing in the shower (hehe) and none of the Evermore songs has had a showing in my ""concert"" playlist.

"A few specific counts would be her m falsely accusing someone of rape and also calling another woman who reported a rape incident a liar because she knew the accused. Each one of these have more details involved but that‚Äôs just kind of the surface.

"So Red really is the album of heartbreak, I wasn‚Äôt planning on being so sad so close to release week, but last night I had a horrible fight with my best friend who I was visiting for the weekend, it lasted about 5 min, an All Too Well original version long fight, then we spent two hours talking and crying (well, I did the crying and when I start I can‚Äôt stop, I could feel the mascara run is the description of my life üòÇ), we made up really quickly and are totally fine now, I‚Äôm just sorry of being such a mess and can‚Äôt really forgive myself for ruining the evening, I felt burnout and finally exploded and lashed out and he did too, but then, in the best tradition of Taylor‚Äôs songs, walked me to my hotel at past 2am, it was locked and had to ring the bell and call the night receptionist. I went to bed at 4am and woke up 5 hours later only to discover that my train home for this afternoon was canceled and had to hurry to the station and change it with an earlier one, I‚Äôm on it now, and still feeling so burnout and exhausted that I cried for hours this morning too. Now I‚Äôm much calmer, on the train listening to my sad songs and waiting for Friday, in my case there isn‚Äôt absolutely anything romantic involved, if we aren‚Äôt counting my three loving cats and one of them being convinced to be my boyfriend, just feeling emotionally drained and tired. Yesterday I was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a DAMN about Taylor and Red TV, I just want to feel better‚Äù, but of course it was just a moment‚Ä¶ Obviously I still want to feel better, but I want and need Red TV too lol. So I hope everyone else is having the best day and week and is ready to enjoy the album this Friday, I apologize for being a whining mess and giving too much information, I never do that but for some reason just felt like it today, as this place is full of nice people.

"I still don't care for ME! and it took until a revisiting of RED post-Folklore that I found appreciation for Stay Stay Stay which used to be a hard skip and eye roll from me when RED came out in my late 20s.   


Both of these songs relate to people of a different age and expands her music portfolio. Stay Stay Stay builds her connection to a wider audience intergenerationally. ME! was such a brilliant aesthetic and sound internationally which would grow her audience globally.   


Stay Stay Stay is intentionally childish. That kid's xylophone accent, her giggling her way through lyrics. Wasn't this written when she date the Kennedy who was younger than her at the time? It sounds age appropriate of someone in their early 20s going through the motions of figuring out how to communicate without throwing tantrums. Her lyrics are sharp ""self indulgent takers"" are literally the worst. I still cringe at coming in in a football helmet but hey for some that's cute! What's actually really sweet about the song is her realizing that she actually enjoys spending time with someone without it being a struggle because she's becoming more self-aware about how she shows up in relationship.   


ME!, Shake It Off, (CONTROVERSIAL) Love Story, We Are Never Getting Back Together become too overly played on radio for me to enjoy them. They become skips simply because you can't escape their air play. They're brilliant because TSwift can write to all different genres and composition, and remain commercially magnetic!

"Those original Fearless songs were recorded really fast.  I saw Nathan tell a story about how they took a few hours on You Belong With Me to get some production details right  so only did that one song in the morning and then he was told by a Big Machine rep they can't spend that much time on one song because it costs too much.  So Nathan recorded 4 songs with Taylor that afternoon.  Then Nathan got a call that night from Taylor's people asking Nathan to take it easy on her because she really tired herself out recording that many songs.   For the first two albums she was recording her vocals while singing live with the three piece band as well so she was doing a lot of singing while they worked out production.  She was also touring constantly back then so you can imagine she was tired a lot of the time.

Some of that I think is a factor in why for Speak Now, Taylor and Nathan decided to just work out of his home studio just the two of them.   They created demos, but they used her demo vocals for the final tracks.  Nathan talked about how when they started Speak Now that they agreed he would send her home if she wasn't singing well and she would tell him when his production wasn't working.  

On the other side from Taylor's vocals Nathan did talk about how Taylor would watch him playing the guitar and stop him if it sounded too much like Nashville session musician. She wanted it to sound like a normal person playing guitar.",neutral
I'm wondering if she didn't choose this song as a single to maintain her post-folklore image of more of a songwriter than a popstar. It's the only song on 1989 without any cowriters and it's the most quiet song on the album. If that's the case then Clean might be the next single for the same reason.,sexism

"I‚Äôll probably be adding to this comment later, because where do I start? I‚Äôm not going to try and convince anyone to make this their favorite Taylor album, so I‚Äôll just list my reasons why I love SPEAK NOW:
  
1) This album is pure Taylor. I know every album is a Taylor album, but I love the fact that she did not have any co-writers on this album. I love knowing that every note and lyric was written solely by her.
  
2) Arguably, this is the final album of the ‚Äúcountry-pop‚Äù trilogy for Taylor. It‚Äôs the final form of the beginning of her musical journey. She takes everything she has learned in her career thus far, and created this masterpiece.
  
3) This album is her successful transition from teenager to young woman, which can be tricky since she has been in the public eye since she was 15/16. (From Mine: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a drawer of my things at your place.‚Äù)

What does that have to do with her success?

Artistically, she has accomplished a lot and worked non-stop since her debut. I think she'd like to focus solely on her personal life for a few years.

I believe she really wants to get married and build her own family (and keep them away from the spotlight) and I can see it happening soon.

"I don't see why not, Folklore and Evermore are generally much lower, and she hasn't been on tour in 4 years, but those notes are in her live range.

The rerecordings have gone up to at least E5 (obvs in a studio, but she still had to hit them once), so it's not like she can't sing those notes. Maybe she's out of practice but I don't see why she'd be unable to hit notes she was hitting a few years ago.

"Never knew any of that! So cool! I definitely think the Love Triangle of Folklore takes a lot of heavy inspiration from her past relationships (while still not actually being about her/her exes, you know?). I've always thought of the August girl as being similar to Tom Hiddleston, and the reason why is because their romance was a summer whirlwind, and the relationship to the 'getaway' car. Obviously Getaway Car is about Tom in some fashion (I'm of the opinion he's the ""you"" in that song, and Calvin is the ""he"", but I know other theories exist out there). But obviously August girl tells James/Taylor to ""get in the car"", and gets him away from where he is. And the whole ""living for the hope of it all"" is not only a very romantic notion, but it's also idealistic. Maybe August girl knows, deep deep down, that James isn't hers even in the midst of their relationship (she certainly knows it in hindsight). When you look at the stuff Tom said/did both during and after the relationship, I think (and I say this as a big fan of Tom's, have been since long before him and Taylor, and he is an incredibly sincere and genuine and big-hearted romantic, so I think this fits the bill) that he was definitely living for the hope of it all. I think his perspective on their romance was very much August girl's perspective on her romance with James.

On that note, I do think James is a bit Taylor, but I also think there's a strong hint of Joe, actually - in Betty, when he says ""I was nowhere to be found - I hate the crowds, you know that - plus, I saw you dance with him"" could be a bit of an interpretation of the events at the Met Gala, because even though Taylor and Joe likely met there/around that time (references from Dress indicate it), Taylor was obviously dancing with Tom, and it could have been interpreted as her romantic interest was headed for Tom's direction instead of Joe's. Plus I can totally see Joe as being shy, or at least just not liking public attention, which is in part indicated by his great ability to keep his personal life out of the spotlight.

Anyway, enough of my rambles haha. My point is the same as I said at the beginning, which is that I think there's enough evidence that she drew from past experiences/perspectives, but that none of the fictionalized stuff in her Folklore/Evermore album is *about* her. Kind of like what an author does - I think Rowling once described characters as being like horcruxes; they all have a little piece of your soul.",neutral

"Thanks for the link. I think that it's possible that he could have been referring to when became a father for the 2nd time in September 2017. 

This is the quote: ""I‚Äôd just become a father. I was not in the room when the melody and the lyrics were written. Max and Shellback did half of the album with her in L.A., and I had done this \[instrumental\] track‚Äîwhich is weird too, because I don‚Äôt do tracks.""

His first child was in March 2015. She still had to start the 1989 tour in May 2015. To me, it seems quite early to be actively writing with other people trying to make a new album. Oscar Gorres wrote that Max and Shellback did half of the album with her in LA as if they had already done half the album in LA at this stage. Max and Shellback did 9 songs on the album with Taylor while the remaining 6 were with Jack Antonoff. September seems a bit late additions but she has done this before. Hoax and The 1 were written after the Folklore album had been completed. We know that Forever and Always was also a late addition to Fearless.

An argument could be made for both but I'm inclined to think that it was written in 2017.",neutral

Since your list includes **New Romantics** and the phrase ""*try to base my life in*"" truly resonates with me, I'm gonna mention this.

I recently watched [this video at 2:02](https://youtu.be/lPpjQMRhcXA?t=122) titled 1989 SONGS AS ZODIAC SIGNS ( TAYLOR SWIFT ).

Years ago, I was in a toxic relationship with a Sagittarius guy. It was my first experience of love, so it's nice that the corresponding song for Sagittarius is the very therapeutic **Clean**.

Soon, it moves to **I Know Places** for Capricorn, reminding me of my most recent relationship. Although we went our separate ways, I will always have the deepest of love for him.

Then, **New Romantics** comes in with the insane energy, and it feels like a new guy just inserts himself into my life out of nowhere. Aquarius and Libra (my sign) are also compatible after all.",neutral

"I loved State of Grace acoustic for that exact reason - she sang the song in a higher key, and at the same time she used a whisper singing technique. The combination was magical.

What made it so special to me was that in 2012, hardly anybody was using that technique in mainstream music. It‚Äôs more common today and a lot of people seem to love it. Artists like Billie Eilish &amp; Selena Gomez do it a lot. It works really well when you‚Äôre listening on headphones too, even though OG Red was produced with stereo play in mind. 


For me, I adored that version of the song because it was my first introduction to that technique. It‚Äôs sad that she didn‚Äôt do it again, but I also think she might not have been able to. I noticed on Fearless and Red TVs and in recent performances, Taylor‚Äôs voice has matured to a point where she can‚Äôt hit some of those higher notes anymore or sing in those higher keys for prolonged amounts of time. Which is totally normal because she‚Äôs 10 years older and she sings more in her middle to lower registers now. It‚Äôs just a shame that State of Grace acoustic had to suffer üò©",neutral
I wonder if it‚Äôs because her label made her do it so she was ‚Äúmore country‚Äù. And I wonder if that‚Äôs another way she can reclaim her music.,sexism

"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the fact the hate train is taking off again. It‚Äôs simply the fact that everyone‚Äôs opinions are easier to access. Before in 2016. Everyone was mostly speaking on Twitter. But the presence Twitter has had in peoples lives has since then increased. And social media in general. People‚Äôs opinions are so much accessible on new sites such as tiktok as well. It‚Äôs just easier for us to read and hear about people‚Äôs opinion.  

It is much different to now. Up until 2016. Much of who she was on interviews, magazine  was pretty much a carefully orchestrated persona. She didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat. Her fans knew her for who she was. But the media painted whatever narrative they wanted. She was ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs sweetheart‚Äù. ‚ÄòA good girl‚Äô. And they really wanted the ‚ÄúAmerican sweetheart‚Äù to fall. She said it in her documentary. And that leaked phone call. 

Ever since reputation. She‚Äôs shown make aspects of who she is behind closed doors, well her personality at least, more well known.  But also knows what ways to limit the media‚Äôs influence on her life. 

Taylor swift is probably one of the most self aware celebrities. And biggest icons. She‚Äôs always going to have the media closely scrutinising her life. Where as 2016 and before whilst it might have directed her life. Ever since reputation it‚Äôs increasingly becoming her utilising it. She‚Äôs a smart business women. 

Did she re release red to spite her exes? Of course not. She wanted ownership of her masters. She wanted to please the fans. But she‚Äôs smart. She chose to actors who were the same age difference as jake and her when they dated in the short film. People are going to talk about her life regardless, she does it in a way in which she benefits from it. She‚Äôs a celebrity who lets her work do the talking.  

all the talk about her personal life ultimately is free publicity. People who aren‚Äôt Taylor swift fans Are becoming aware of her music.  Like I‚Äôm from London. Most of my friends don‚Äôt listen to her. But they haven‚Äôt even able to shake off hearing about all too well and red . And with all the free publicity, scrutiny and opinion that comes with her, she now weaponises that to talk about stuff that matters. Politics. The music industry. Artists rights. 

But do people hate her. No. One article said that critics can look at Taylor‚Äôs music with more objectivity.   Marie Claire said ""divorcing music from the sexist media narrative that followed her during her adolescence, inviting listeners and critics to engage with the same songs today without as much gender bias"". All her re releases thus far are receiving universal acclaim. Which they didn‚Äôt previously didnt do. 

Remember. As much as fans love Taylor swift as a person. She‚Äôs also a business women. And a pretty smart one. I don‚Äôt think her fans need to be worried about any ‚Äúhate train‚Äù developing.  And hey society isn‚Äôt black and white. People will love you or hate you. But from the miss Americans documentary. We know that Taylor doesn‚Äôt give a crap about it as much anymore.",sexism

"I fell for Taylor during 1989. I‚Äôd just moved to LA and listened to the radio while driving often and she was always on. Blank Space and Style are BOPS, y‚Äôall. But I was confused because I was a pick-me in college who hated country music and what in the world was I doing liking TAYLOR SWIFT!?!?!? Guys I was even obsessed with Shake It Off‚ÄîI danced to it in front of a guy who eventually became my boyfriend, and I was like omg I can get the guy and like Taylor!? Game-changer. And then a friend played me the whole album and I was like, ummmm how is every song good!? I kept waiting for something to come on I didn‚Äôt like but y‚Äôall have heard 1989 so that just didn‚Äôt happen. 

Rep is my favorite era, still to this day. She probably could‚Äôve put out anything as that first single (and compared to the rest of the album, she kinda did) and I would‚Äôve been in. After 1989 I trusted her to make great music. I enjoyed the Lover era less‚Äîthe singles and the album itself tbh, although I only admit that now, never then bc at that point I was in too deep. I explored her other albums and realized just how consistently good she‚Äôs been, how many non-singles are some of the best songs I‚Äôve ever enjoyed, and I just‚Ä¶ ugh I love our girl ü•∞ 

This folkmore era is def the type of music I enjoy most and to hear her master it so well just really impressed me. Her lyrics and voice get consistently better year after year. I‚Äôm def a folklore bitch over evermore, but again, I admire that she takes risks, tries new sounds, and does them expertly. And now this has become a comment about how much I love her lol",neutral

"IMO, two main reasons: 

1. This is arguably her most loved album in the fandom. I truly think she wanted to lean in and celebrate the songs and moments from Red that we all adore/have been longing for - giving us the 10 minute version of All Too Well after years of begging, sharing her version of Better Man and Babe, etc. I don‚Äôt think any other album will have this kind of hype around the vault songs (outside of Debut for the OG Swifties). The Red TV rollout was FOR us, and for her to be in those moments WITH us.

2. Red did not receive a Grammy, yet it is one of her most critically acclaimed albums - All Too Well particularly being her most critically acclaimed and praised song in her entire discography. She is giving it proper attention and care. ATWTMV will very likely be nominated for a Grammy, and very likely win, thus giving it the praise it rightfully deserved in the first place.",neutral

"Hear me out. Maybe it's a coincidence but one of April's birth flowers, I found out today, is a daisy. I love the symbolism of the daisy in Taylor's songs (""now I'm your daisy"") and the reference to the Daisy, the character from Great Gatsby, is also incredibly powerful. 

From an essay by Elisha Wise: ""Though evermore's seventh track ""happiness"" makes reference to the green light ‚Äî the symbolic representation of Gatsby's dreams ‚Äî Swift does not seek this light as Gatsby does.2 Instead, she positions herself in the Daisy role of potential granter of its promises when she sings ""all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness."" Coupled with her adaptation of Daisy's famous meditation on ideal womanhood into the lyric ""I hope she'll be a beautiful fool / Who takes my spot next to you"" on this same track, Swift's allusions to The Great Gatsby seem specifically deployed to examine the constrictive roles that men expect women to fulfill."" ([full essay here](http://post45.org/2020/12/zelda-daisy-taylor-beautiful-fools/))

If intentional, then the release of Fearless in April the month of daisies shows ‚Äî in my mind at least ‚Äî a refusal to be that ""beautiful little fool"" (The Great Gatsby) and rather choose to be a daisy living fearlessly.",neutral

It would be nice if she did but Taylor doesn‚Äôt likely know her release dates that far in advance.

But I don‚Äôt see all of your other points.

For coney island, they‚Äôre literally in coney island ‚Ä¶ as the title suggests. ‚ÄúWe were like the mall before the internet‚Äù is a simile (figure of speech) for when people used to spend their time with other people and meet up, but now they‚Äôre quite empty because everyone has been using the internet. They‚Äôre not in a mall which is why they say ‚ÄúWe were like the mall‚Äù not ‚ÄúWe are in a mall‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting on a bench in coney island wondering where did my baby go‚Äù describes the gist of the song and tells you that they‚Äôre on a bench in coney island ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how it can get more literal than that. If you look up coney island online, you‚Äôll see pictures of a dreary-looking place with fog all over and carnivals that look kinda sad and deserted. The characters are sitting on a bench in coney island, and even though they‚Äôre sitting right next to each other, they can‚Äôt seem to find the other person because they‚Äôre relationship is now so different from what it was before. It used to be exciting like the mall before the internet, like a carnival ‚Äúwith bright lights‚Äù. It used to fun and full of life, and now, as you can see in images of coney island, it‚Äôs dreary and quite mundane. The song is the two people analyzing their relationship in their heads and how it all went wrong while sitting on a bench in coney island.

I think tolerate it is a good track 5. I don‚Äôt really get when swifties question Taylor‚Äôs choice of track fives because track fives are personal, emotional, vulnerable songs to Taylor. Why do we get to decide what is personal to Taylor?

With closure, I don‚Äôt get what you mean with that line. I think it perfectly describes what it feels like to be content with what you have now especially as an adult.

"Agree with a lot of what is said here, that said I don‚Äôt know if I buy into the idea that it‚Äôs a stand in for her virginity. It‚Äôs possible for sure, but to me the scarf is just a scarf. I‚Äôve thought a lot about it and I think including it is meant to capture that feeling/phenomenon of when a relationship ends, the little meaningless things are what you can‚Äôt forget or get rid of. All of the sudden the things that seemed innocuous now haunt you. Every time you see a car that‚Äôs the same color/model as the one your ex had, every time you hear his/her fav band, seeing clothes that remind you of stuff they wore, stupid things like their ancestry‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all a dagger and it‚Äôs impossible to avoid. Sometimes things trigger you and you don‚Äôt even expect it. So if she left the scarf and he was planning to give it back but didn‚Äôt for whatever reason, then they broke up‚Ä¶ he kept it because it‚Äôs something tangible fo hang on to because the relationship meant something to him too (no matter how toxic). It‚Äôs a meaningless object sure, but really it‚Äôs not because it connects you to every minute when she wore the scarf. Just like the other things can be so meaningful even though they aren‚Äôt- like a specific car or a jacket or whatever. You can‚Äôt get rid of how any of those objects haunt you and maybe you don‚Äôt want to in a way.

"I think people make legitimate critiques of the way she makes use of and benefits from capitalism. Like it or not, being an extremely wealthy person in this world comes with all manner of ethical complications, because in a capitalist society, accumulating wealth comes *at the expense of other people*. For example, she's able to make money off merch because it's made cheaply in countries without strong labor laws. She has a great deal of wealth in property, but the ownership of multiple houses reduces the availability of land and housing available for other people. Like, it's awesome that she's successful, but I think a lot of Swifties would be happy to see her be a little more self-aware when it comes to her wealth and a little more radical about how she uses it.",sexism

"Just because she is writing about a topic in an earnest way does not mean it is her actual reality. She explicitly said a lot of folklore and evermore were inspired by other forms of media she consumed during quarantine (during FLPS). Do you also believe she had an affair (Illicit Affairs and Ivy) or that she divorced a good man after 7 years of marriage (Happiness)?  Tolerate It was also track 5, the ‚Äòdeeply personal‚Äô track which she herself said was inspired by ‚ÄúRebecca"" by Daphne Du Maurier (mentioned in her Rolling Stone interview). Most of the lyrics and songs you mentioned are not necessarily about romantic love, all of them could be inspired by other situations, using artistic license to give them broader meanings and multiple interpretations.

You‚Äôre also ignoring all the songs on those albums that appear to be about being in a stable, loving relationship (Dress, Call It What You Want, New Years Day, Lover, Paper Rings, Cornelia Street, Daylight, Invisible String, Peace, Long Story Short, Sweet Nothing, Paris, Glitch etc).

Like I said, again, music means different things to different people when viewed through the lens of their own personal experiences. It‚Äôs not all entirely autobiographical, there is no entirely right or entirely wrong interpretation but to insist that her relationship is in dire straights because of your own interpretation is an odd hill to die on.",neutral

If she follows this pattern, this year she'll be releasing some thing on summer and other on winter, and in 2023 on spring and fall again. My guess is that she'll ""show up just in time"" to release the next TV during the summer. Probably she'll announce it first, but she might wait the most she can this time, because from Red TV announcement until the release were several months apart, and now she can twist the expectations doing the opposite. I think that 1989 TV is coming next, in two discs to be released together. She already teased it with two known songs, Wildest dreams and This love, and later she could focus solely on the vault tracks, since probably she will release several of them.",neutral

"The reputation nominations came out in November 2018 so Taylor was already recording Lover. It is a bit surprising she was so down given the boost she got from the tour.

The rest of the world knows she has nothing to prove to anyone but she still beats herself up because she is not reaching the highest possible standard in her eyes.

A lot has happened to Taylor since 2018. I hope after all the success she has had since then she no longer feels the need to chase awards. Free and uninhibited Taylor wrote Folklore and Evermore so hopefully she will follow her muse for TS10 and not worry about the judgement of the Grammys. The irony is of course in freeing herself from that stress she is more likely to succeed.",neutral

"An almost 32 yearold gay male here. while it‚Äôs not a huge reach, from an outside looking in perspective, for someone like me to like her, it really didn‚Äôt happen until around the same time as yourself. In high school, I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of her. I could see the talent and it just wasn‚Äôt for me. Fast forward to WANGBT and I was going through a rough time dating. It was my anthem along with 22 (since I was 22 when it came out). This was getting me to warm up. Cue 1989 and everything about that album had me. It‚Äôs almost like she was feeling how I was and was able to put it into words that helped make such a transitional time in my life easier. No matter what was happening, she has this sound and feel like she‚Äôs one of your friends on a night out and has just the perfect song that‚Äôs what you need to hear. This element that the song was almost written for you. Reputation happened to come out during a darker time and more emotional, again like she was there in my life. It was during the pandemic when I was 14 hours away in a new city and alone that All Too Well came on.. the lyrics hit hard and I stopped what I was doing. To hear those lyrics, really hear them and to see that pain on her face.. time really did stand still. It was painfully beautiful. This prompted me to go back to the earlier albums and with the TV version, really enjoy where she came from to where I joined to present day. My nieces are still a little young for some of the songs, but they know who she is.  They call her ‚ÄúTaylor slip‚Äù and it‚Äôs funny when the played the song ‚ÄúME!‚Äù Trying to introduce me to a song they like. Imagine the surprise on their face when I knew every word. Lol. I let them know that she‚Äôs been around since I was in high school. They couldn‚Äôt comprehend, lol. Having those three nieces makes me so happy that it‚Äôs at a time where they get to see a woman take control of her career and the narrative.

"Totally agree with you that Evermore is her best album (although I admit to a slight bias for that album over folklore :) )However, the claim that most important poetry has been written by people over 30 is not correct. Many have been, and some of my favorite creative works are those written by people over 30 who have worked to hone their craft and have the benefit of more life experience and maturity, especially now that I‚Äôve hit that benchmark ‚Äì honestly, poets in that demographic often tend to be my favorites. However, there are many examples of creatives who wrote culturally significant works before 30 including:-Shakespeare, who wrote two of his plays and started his sonnet collection 

\-T.S. Eliot, who wrote Prufrock and Other Observations

\-Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar

\-Allen Ginsburg, Howl

\-Audre Lorde, since while her first full collection was published after 30, she was a prolific poet before then with works including her beautiful poem Spring when she was only 15

\-Langston Hughes, The Weary Blues

\-W.B. Yeats, many including Song of the Fairies and Voices

\-Phillis Wheatley

\-Percy Shelly 

\-John Keats

And for more recent examples there's Amanda Gorman, Sandra Beasley, Ocean Vuong, just to name a few.

To be fair though, it depends on what you mean by 'important' - most critically acknowledged as well written? Most longstanding cultural significance? Most popular with the general public in their time? In the end, I do love creatives where I can trace the growth and bloom of their artistry as they mature, and I do think that for many writers who start in their 20s or earlier, you really start to see them come into their own in their post-30s work!",neutral

"Red was an era I kind of missed, so there are actually songs on this album I still haven‚Äôt heard, but based on the ones I know, here‚Äôs my answer:

Best: All Too Well. I actually used to think this song was overrated but the 10 min version made me see the light. I love it now and I think the writing in it is incredible.

Overrated: We are Never Ever Getting Back Together. It‚Äôs cute and I like that it‚Äôs a bit tongue in cheek but I don‚Äôt really love the song, and I think it was overplayed. I do love the rock version from the 1989 tour though.

Underrated: Stay Stay Stay. I think it‚Äôs cute and fun. Not her best or anything but so many people seem to hate it.

Worst: Girl At Home. Probably my least favorite Taylor song ever.",neutral

I don‚Äôt see this at all. As soon as I heard the song I came to the conclusion that it was about Scott Borchetta. Because for some reason whenever people talk about Taylor‚Äôs master situation they always forget to mention him. They always say scooter did this and scooter did that. Always forgetting the man who sold her masters to a man that he knew made Taylor cry. Scott was like family to Taylor and probably like family to the rest of her family and he betrayed her. She would have much more of an emotional response to him then scooter or probably even calvin. From what we know it seems like Taylor left calvin so why would he think she‚Äôs the one who needs closure. I also think my tears ricochet is about Scott.,neutral

"The originals are something that so many of us know by heart, every little bit of each of those albums. That can‚Äôt be replicated. For some songs the production and/or emotion are lost in the re-recorded version.

The reality is Taylor is doing this for herself, which is great. Also, as fans we can choose what we want to listen to and by Taylor saying things like the originals are ‚Äúunethical‚Äù she‚Äôs trying to deplete their value. She needs to get people on board to listen to the new versions. Taylor is a saleswoman.

I don‚Äôt mean this as a bad thing, however, it is okay to listen to what you like. If you enjoy the newer version, go for it. If you like the original, cool. I love Taylor but I‚Äôm not going to take ethics lessons from a woman that has multiple homes and private jets.",neutral

People (mostly sexist men) despise her because she is breaking their fave artists records. They are stuck in their ways and are intimidated by a successful woman. They believe that all women belong in the kitchen. Then there's women with 'not like other girls' syndrome who hate on her because they think they're edgy, or they're just jealous.

"I like your taste! I also adore Come Back, Be Here, and don't love Wonderland.

Here are the bonus tracks that I think should have been on the album proper:

1. New Romantics: def should have been on 1989, probably should have been a single. I would have loved to see a video with her friends, like a more positive Bad Blood (or a more mature 22)
2. Ours: obvi
3. Come Back, Be Here: I didn't hear this one for a while after Red came out, and discovering it made me fall in love with the album all over again. So beautiful, so wistful, and it fits so perfectly with the aesthetic of the album. I actually like ""Stay Stay Stay,"" but since it sounds more like a Fearless song, it would have made a better bonus track.
4. You Are In Love: the 1989 bonus tracks are just insanely good. This definitely could have been on the album instead of This Love, or How You Get the Girl.
5. the lakes: Folklore was so cohesive, I was afraid that any bonus track wouldn't fit, but I absolutely love this one. The lyrics are gorgeous. I never got the hate for the ""no one around to tweet it"" line--escaping modernity is the whole point of the song!
6. Untouchable: I'm actually okay with this being a bonus track, since covers are unusual for her, but I think Untouchable is generally underrated. The subtle crescendo of the instrumentals is so lovely.
7. Come in With the Rain: I honestly didn't know for a long time that this was a bonus track. To me the writing feels so quintessentially Taylor, especially the line, ""I know you by heart / but you don't even know where I start.""

Invisible, Jump Then Fall, and right where you left me are also great, but I'm okay with them as bonus tracks. Not as big a fan of A Perfectly Good Heart, Girl at Home, or Wonderland, and feel kind of neutral about the rest. I've actually never really listened to Superman much, for exactly the reasons you mentioned, but maybe I should give it another try.

Edited to add that both Forever and Always Piano Version and State of Grace acoustic should have been on their respective albums (although I love the original versions as well).",neutral

"&gt;its about showing respect and loyalty for what they did to her. Thats like saying your best friend tells you... 

But it's not like that at all. Taylor Swift is not my friend. I admire her enormously and adore her music, but at the end of day, she is a complete stranger. I don't owe her anything (other than being respectful and not pirating her music). I don't feel any kind of personal obligation to sacrifice my listening experience, and nor should anyone have it imposed on them. Taylor's also worth about $400 million so I hardly think some listeners preferring her original work is going to cause financial hardship.

I think it comes down to the Death of the Author concept. Once a piece of art is out there you cannot control how it is interpreted. It belongs, in a sense, to the audience now. So as much as I respect Taylor's power move with the re-recordings, it doesn't dictate to me how I listen to her music. I am just grateful for her talent and steady output of new material.

Or perhaps this comes down to the nature of fandom, whether you're specifically a Taylor Swift fan or just have a deep love of her music. I've been a big stan of certain artists in my life so I do understand the sense of loyalty. I respect that and think it's a tremendous gift - fans like yourself and new Swifites will indeed make Taylor's version the definitive one.",neutral

Taylor Swift - Our Song   
\- I like A Place in This World thematically for the title track, but she seems to pick shorter title tracks.  Plus given her personalized storytelling nature the Our Song would fit an overall theme of writing songs for individual people she knows.  


1989 - New Romantics  
\- I love New Romantics as a title track, but I'd go Wildest Dreams if I have to pick a standard edition track.  Capturing the young 20s love feel.  


Reputation - Getaway Car

Everyone also claims to hate her songs while, as I said, they rarely can quote more than two. You're often seen as a weirdo if you listen to her.

It's extremely rare to see her CDs in-store (at least now). We don't hear her too much on the radio either (from last year to now, I recall Love Story TV, ATW TV, and ...Ready For It? one time each). I just know about some TV shows -one in particular- where the staff has clearly swifties part of it.

"See I was a little nervous about getting one of the suitcase record players, as I heard horror stories. But for me I already had a primary set up, just kind of wanted a cheap second player for another room in my house. I‚Äôve played vintage and new, and both have sounded good for an internal speaker! Now my biggest thing with the suitcase player, is the sound. Definitely not something you can turn on full volume and sound great. And you don‚Äôt want the loud speaker  volume to create vibrations and mess with the record. But I think they are very beginner friendly, not as bad as people make them seem. For a casual player , they are more than fine. In my experience, you give someone a cheap player or an advance player who is inexperienced and they will have issues either way. I think spend as much money as you are going to play it. But don‚Äôt feel insecure if you just want to start out with someone small and simple. Oh I forgot to add in my initial post, but no mater what set up you get, I would recommend for a beginner getting a player with a built in pre amp. Just personal opinion on that though!",neutral

Red TV is too close to release but Fearless TV alone is higher than what Fearless would be if she didn‚Äôt re-record and Taylor gets 3-5+ times more money from the re-records. Rousing success for her.

One interesting thing is when she release 1989 TV based on losing 50% of its streams, 1989 OG will still be on the billboard 200 so it would give her 9 simultaneous entries which is pretty much a situation that happens the week after someone dies. Instead it will be new normal for her.",neutral

"I love the 10-minute version because the storytelling in it is phenomenal and paints a much more complete picture of what the song is about. There's still heartbreak, but there's also an explicit sense of anger that was hinted at but largely danced around with the 5 minute, which was more devastated about the end than furious about how the narrator was treated in the actual relationship AND devastated about the end. Basically, 10 min version describes abuse which the first mostly didn't. There are lines that hint at it in the original, but without the full context of the 10 minute they could also just easily refer to heartbreak over a poorly handled breakup.

That said, I still love the 5 minute version too. The vocal was definitely more raw on the original, which makes sense given how much more recent the events had taken place. I don't really compare them in my mind because they are two completely separate songs for me.",neutral

"Law360 (September 28, 2021, 9:32 PM EDT) -- A California federal judge told lawyers for Taylor Swift at a Tuesday hearing that he was having a hard time seeing why a four-year copyright fight over the lyrics in her hit single ""Shake It Off"" should not be decided by a jury, since the question over ownership turns on how the lyrics are read, not the law.  
  
U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald said at the hearing that very little appeared to have changed since the Ninth Circuit overturned his 2018 ruling that initially threw out the lawsuit leveled by songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, who accused Swift of cribbing lines from her chart-topping 2014 single from the 3LW song ""Playas Gon' Play"" that was a hit on R&amp;B radio in 2001.  
  
""I think the defense has put forward a really strong closing argument,"" Judge Fitzgerald said about Swift's bid to end the suit, which he turned down in a tentative ruling that morning. But it didn't appear to be enough to end the case before going to trial.  
  
""I'm not sure that I'm seeing what puts it over the line to make it an issue of law,"" the judge said.  
  
Swift attorney Peter Anderson of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP used the hearing to take shots at the lines from Butler and Hall's song that the pair was seeking to protect.  
  
""There isn't a single adjective, there is no color, there is no embellishment,"" Anderson said on Tuesday about the lyrics in ""Playas Gon' Play.""  
  
The 3LW record featured the lines ""Playas, they gonna play"" and ""Haters, they gonna hate."" Swift's song features the line ""'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.""  
  
In their suit, the songwriters estimate that the allegedly infringing chorus accounts for approximately 20% of the lyrics in ""Shake It Off.""  
  
Swift's latest effort to throw out the suit hinged on her argument that the lines were short enough to be covered by the public domain. Her lawyers had drummed up a history of the word ""player"" and ""hater,"" as used in songwriting and elsewhere, from Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" to Outkast's ""Player's Ball"" to R. Kelly's ""Feelin' on Yo Booty"" to the comedy ""Next Friday"" starring Ice Cube.  
  
Butler and Hall's attorney Marina Bogorad of Gerard Fox Law PC had countered by emphasizing the similarity between the lines in the two songs at issue.  
  
""The first two phrases are exactly the same, the second two phrases are paraphrases,"" she said. ""Case law shows that paraphrasing is no better than literal copying.""  
  
Judge Fitzgerald noted that he had one of his clerks write out the lyrics in the two songs and laid them out ""side by side."" This analysis had made it ""very difficult to say that there isn't substantial similarity"" between the lines in the two songs, he said.  
  
""They are what they are. So how are you getting around that?"" he asked.  
  
In an emailed statement to Law360, Bogorad accused Swift's legal team of ""trying to avoid the jury at all costs.""  
  
""The overwhelming similarities between the choruses at issue compel the court's ear to yield to the jury's collective ears here,"" she added.  
  
Representatives for Swift did not respond to a request for comment.  
  
Hall and Butler are represented by Gerard P. Fox and Marina V. Bogorad of Gerard Fox Law PC.  
  
Swift and the other defendants are represented by Peter Anderson and Arleen Fernandez of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP.  
  
The case is Hall et al. v. Swift et al., case number 2:17-cv-06882, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

There is a lot of infighting with old radio gatekeepers, anger that a Korean company owns Big Machine and anger that Scott and Scooter insisted she was bluffing about re-recording her songs. I've had people sitting in my establishment like I do not exist, gleefully talking about submitting bullshit to Foxella and Blind Gossip about Taylor because they're too out of touch to know about deuxmoi. Corporate takeover of country radio is not as complete as it sometimes looks, and those old gatekeepers are as mad about losing their power to make or break careers from a shitty room in a shitty city as they are about all the ""mouthy women"" in country now, and they directly blame Taylor and Natalie Maines. Hell, the Chicks are still bitched about and it's been like 20 years since they bucked the country radio establishment. Crossing over to pop is tricky for a lot of Nashville acts, too, because once that horse is out of the barn country decision-makers feel snubbed for what they see as the liberal godlessness of mainstream pop.

I promise, these old dudes hate women and blame her for making too many of the current generation of female country singers too opinionated. Any who can step on the number of spins this gets will, because that's how things work here. It's shitty.",sexism

I had a friend that worked at a drug store where they had the only ticketron machine in the county, the store owner was sketchy and he'd pump out tickets when there was something like Bruce Springsteen going on sale before he'd unlock the doors to the public.  My buddy called me one day back long ago and said 'I didn't know if you'd want tickets to Prince, but I got 2 for you if you want them, if not no big deal I can scalp them'.  I was going out with a girl from South Philly and told her 'I got tickets for Prince if you want to go' and she want bananas.  It was his 'Purple Rain' tour, so it was a really big deal and sold out in minutes. I got tickets to anything I wanted back then, and tickets were pretty cheap compared to now, like $30 range for good seats.

Even Stevie‚Äôs own acoustic version that‚Äôs available otherwise doesn‚Äôt have the crucial lyric change that she delivers here: ‚Äúlightning struck only once.‚Äù

Plus the song is being used as the theme for a series about a queer woman stuck in an unhappy marriage, pursuing a particularly toxic younger woman and unraveling both at work and at home as she tries to find some way for her life to be real. The writing is pretty terrible and there are major reality gaps, but Naomi Watts is really moving in it and the general theme of being that desperate to do something real with your heart, body, or life is captured perfectly in the song and ITS.

"The song itself is a triple entendre that tells 3 different stories. 1) A high profile high school relationship. 2) Taylors relationship with the media and her fans. 3) Taylors struggle with sharing her political beliefs. You could also argue that it is 4) A version of ""You Belong With Me"" from the viewpoint of the love interest's girlfriend. 

There's a ton of individual lyrics that weave these stories together. I'd be here all day if I went into details on each one but there are a ton of articles online about some of them. I'll give a couple examples. 

""We're so sad we paint the town blue, voted most likely to run away with you."" 

Blue here has two meanings, one invoking sadness and the other the democratic party (blue is their official color). She reemphasizes this with the word ""voted"" which is meant both in the context of high school yearbook voting and voting in political elections. 

""And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really want to (Fight), cause nobody's gonna (Win)""

I think reputation is the hardest to replace. So much of that album and its initial success and reception was based on marketing. She literally disappeared for a year and then deleted all of her instagram to replace it with a giant snake. I mean, ""there will be no explanation, there will just be reputation""??? a perfect way to reenter pop culture after being canceled. She led with a revenge message, but then you find out that so much of the album was about finding true love in secret. As killer as LWYMMD, IDSB, and DBM are, they aren't great album titles and may have backfired with the public, since it pulls the album to close to the revenge narrative. End Game is an option, but also the worst song on the album. Getaway care works OK, but still not as punchy as reputation. If you're going to ditch the marketing and go for the latter half of the album, I think you have to pick delicate",neutral

It appears Joe wrote lines of lyrics and piano melodies that made it into folklore and evermore and were the early foundation of some of the songs.

"Im so sorry to do this OP, and this is not directed at you specifically, but I feel like I have to chime in here and clarify that the title being approved for publication doesn‚Äôt actually mean anything to the release of the album. I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments about what the date might mean, how that could affect her releasing the albums, etc etc. that‚Äôs why I want to chime in and clarify what this actually means. 

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a small business owner who owns trademarks so I have real-life experience with these matters but I am not an expert.

It might shock you to know that Red Taylors Version is NOT approved for publication yet ‚Äî the USPTO has sent remarks to TS legal team to fix some aspects causing confusion. In short, Taylor did release Red Taylors Version without her trademark being approved for publication, published or officially trademarked. 

In short, this step (approved for publication) means that 1989 Taylors Version will be published for anyone to contest her trademark for 30 days following 5/17/22. If anyone with an active trademark believes that her trademark will cause confusion with their trademark, they can put a pause on her trademark being official.

If no one contests her trademark, it will be officially registered ¬Æ or ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for a period of years.

The issue with Speak Now Taylors Version is different; because an audio company filed a trademark application with the words ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù one week before TS team filed her trademark, the USPTO has paused her application, specifically for use in online advertising (ie including social media). Could she still release Speak Now Taylors Version and get the trademark issues worked out later? Sure, but she risks being sued by the other company if their trademark becomes registered. She also has no legal protection against Etsy sellers or anyone else trying to use the words if she publishes without a clear claim to the title.

"I love Lover the song so much, I don't remember super accurately how the single release went but after rep which IMO wasn't my favourite (there's songs I like from it and the album is still something i enjoy from start to finish even if there's tracks that aren't it, but in general i didn't like the vibe of the era, media was on her for the wrong reasons, i get that she had to reclaim her narrative and i think i understand the era but it wasn't my cup of tea), I really was thirsting for something new.


IIRC ME! was the first one and while it was fun it was kinda cheesy as hell so it made me lower my expectations, and then when she put Lover (song) out, it brought them back up again, and got me super hyped. I just love the energy of the song, the subtle instrumentation, clean guitar, the lyrics, her voice in it, the bridge-THE BRIDGE!!!!... Sounds waltzy to me even if i'm not sure if it's in 3/4, and when i'm in that slow-dance song mood this one's my go to.

Also the era holds a special place in my heart because two online swiftie friends from the Discord had The Archer in their wedding video, and to me that's their song and I love it so much more because of it. And another pair of swiftie friends from the same discord got married the year before, and ME! had just came out then so we danced to it at the party and I love the song so much for that too hahaha, spelling really is fun! the album in general just reminds me of actual love and I love it for it. 

Fuck covid for everything in general, but more specifically for the lover fests... i really wanted to vibe at those listening to Lover tracks, bought tickets for two of them.",neutral

"I can‚Äôt see why she wouldn‚Äôt work with him to re-do 1989 and rep, he played a major role in those albums. 

It won‚Äôt be a good look if she uses all the original producers for the first few albums then when it gets to Max‚Äôs songs, use someone else. 

I never heard of a falling out. The only theory about why they‚Äôre not working together is when Taylor said that she has worked with some producers who won‚Äôt produce a song if they don‚Äôt have a co-writing credit even if they didn‚Äôt contribute to lyrics. That probably annoyed Taylor since she‚Äôs really big on lyrics and writing songs by herself.

"Pretty much my favourite theory of all time is that cardigan is actually a love letter to the fans. I wish I screenshot the theory that convinced me, but if you go through each line it really makes sense. Even down to ""sequin smile, black lipstick"" - that was her reputation aesthetic. ""Sensual politics"" - she got political during Lover. ""When you are young they assume you know nothing"" - signing a shitty contract about her masters when she was younger. ""And when I felt like I was an old cardigan... you put me on and said I was your favourite"" - her thanking the fans for staying with her amongst all the craziness. ""Giving me your weekends"" - Taylor loves thanking fans at her concert by saying ""there's a million things you could've been doing this Saturday night but you chose to come see me"". I could analyse the rest of the song if I had time. But I will die on this hill that cardigan is one of her best written songs ever.",neutral

That‚Äôs one of my favourite things about Taylor‚Äôs songs: she takes emotions and presents them in ways you wouldn‚Äôt expect. Like, Delicate is a song you can dance to, but ultimately, it‚Äôs a song about anxiety (the constant questioning, the lack of stability, etc‚Ä¶). Or Cruel Summer, which is a total bop, but it‚Äôs about the agony of falling in love when you know you‚Äôre not supposed to.",neutral

1989: All You Had to Do Was Stay (Track 5 Version) (aka an acoustic version or a piano version a la Forever and Always). 

Welcome to New York Acoustic

Wildest Dreams/Enchanted Mash up

Overall I'm just really excited for the Vault Tracks on this one... This album was SO curated that I can only imagine what amazing songs were left on the cutting room floor.

I hope we get Eyes Open, Safe and Sound, Crazier, and any other soundtrack ones I forgot. 

I'm hoping that all the current features will participate in their respective songs for the rerecords.

Additional Features I'd love to see:

Sara Barielles

Kelly Clarkson

Kesha

Katy Perry 

Selena Gomez

Maggie Rogers

Olivia Rodrigo

Post Malone

Niall Horne

Troye Sivan

The dream feature would be Harry Styles

"I love this song so much. I completely understand the symbolism regarding mental health, but my first listen gave me such a different perspective. 

It reminds me of a short lived but very intense relationship I got into a few years ago. We fell in love fast and hard and promised each other the world; completely felt like each other‚Äôs ‚Äúsoulmates‚Äù. Due to some of his issues and extenuating circumstances, he ended up completely emotionally withdrawing from me, while insisting he still wanted to be with me.

The line ‚Äúis it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything, or do you just not want to?‚Äù Just hits SO hard. It was an incredibly confusing time for me. If I had this song back when that was all going down it might‚Äôve changed my course of action, because I clung to him for far too long.

"Mmmeeeeeeeeee!!! the thing is I didn't have these first few albums on repeat as they came out so I'm just going to enjoy them and not feel like something is off (they're not ingrained in my brain). Speak Now has become one of my favourites over summer, but like Fearless and Red, I just didn't really listen to 'old Taylor' a lot (fan since 1989/rep) even before the masters drama. When the rerecordings came I decided to deep dive with records I had heard a few times but never super connected with. But now I do, and I much appreciate the new vocals. Because to be fair some will just have much better quality. And it's been fun to dive in and know that you're 1. enjoying all this amazing music and 2. supporting the person who made it. But some people have like 15 years of listening ingrained, which makes music familiar so I can see them being a bit more shaken up by changes.  
It's going to be different for 1989 and rep as I am much more familiar with them, so maybe I can then better see the points of people who prefer OG, which is fair. However so far I've wanted to support her decision to rerecord and not give money to SB, so yeah I will for sure have this on repeat once it comes out. I know I love some of the tracks and to be able to hear them with slight differences and better vocals is just super exciting to me! and the vault tracks...

That all happened within the last year or so max. So she more than likely heard about it in the press when everyone else was talking about it, and figured it was convenient timing since she‚Äôll be releasing the song‚Ä¶so she added it in. That‚Äôs all just my opinion, but I think it‚Äôs the more likely scenario here + makes the most sense.

I'm 38, grew up in hardcore punk bands, and now mostly listen to improvisational stuff (jazz, Indian ragas, the Grateful Dead), classical (especially opera), and music focused on songwriting (Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Steely Dan). I put Taylor Swift in the last category. How about you/others?",neutral

"the only thing i don't like about joe isn't even a criticism about him, it's the way the fandom lauds him as being her savior. i really hate the story about how she wanted to break up with him but he said no and that's how we got DWOHT. if that story is true i'm sure it was a much bigger and nuanced conversation that obviously none of us  were apart of, but it turned into just ""he said no &lt;3"" which is really weird to me. it might just be my own personal experience making me feel weird, but i was once in a relationship where i tried to break up with the guy and he convinced me to stay so i did, and it ended with so much more pain and malice. of course, it's been 5 years since DWOHT so it seems to be working for them.  but then she's still writing songs about anxiety in relationships (renegade) and everyone is like ""this is from joe's pov and he's staying that's romance!!!"" but to me the lines ""if i would have known... i might have let them lay"" are saying ""i'm not sure it's worth it, it hurts to be with you, i don't know if i would do it again"" and that's not how anyone should feel in a relationship.

i'm super glad that taylor has a support system and people that love her, but i don't think it's fair to claim joe as the solution to her mental health and trauma. it takes a lot of hard work to overcome the things she has and that wasn't joe's doing. i'm sure that having such a supportive partner makes things a lot easier, but just, seriously, one singular romantic partner is not the solution. 

it's also just kinda hard to get fully on board with their romance when taylor is writing albums about him and he can't even acknowledge the grammy? 

tl;dr- joe is fine, the worship of their relationship is weird to me, but that's celebrity, ya know?  i just don't want young girls to think a man will come and save them bc he probably won't",neutral

"I also have anxiety and depression, and I've been on the other side of loving someone with mental illness. It's hard. The narrator is making this about her because she is the narrator - there's no suggestion that this is being said to the subject of the song, rather that these are just her innermost thoughts. I know that my mental illness hurts the people around me, and I know it's not my fault, but I'm also not going to deny them that hurt. It's a painful and specific experience, and the people going through that deserve to feel seen.

As for the lyric ""is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving my everything / or do you just not want to?"" it seems like I read it very differently from you. For one thing, I don't think she's accusing anything - like I said, I don't think she's meant to be speaking to the subject, only thinking to herself. To me, one of the hardest parts about having anxiety is not knowing what's my mental illness and what's ""me"" - so this is something I think about a lot, and that I'm sure the people who love me think about too, though they're kind enough to never say it out loud. I think the ""everything"" in question is the subject's love - she means that they're not fully in this relationship, and it's hard to know if she should stick it out because this is solely a symptom of their mental illness, or if they're just not that into her anymore.",neutral

I also see the 1 as possibly a good closer. As you go through an album full of stories - and besides invisible string,  most of them being about heartbreak and a failed relationship with someone, she finally gets to a point where she's finally moved passed it and grown.  And now she simply looks back on it as sentimental,  and there's a sense of fondness and an acceptance of finality,  even if it is a little sad, because she knows she's finally ok now.",neutral

Gold Rush - When listened to this for the first time, I didn't like it at all. The three different parts in this song were too jarring that I just didn't enjoy the transitions. It has grown on me since then and now I love it. 

Happiness and Evermore - Both songs have become ""neutral"" for me. Don't love them, don't hate them. They fall in the middle of my ranking because they are average for me. If they are on, I won't skip them anymore so I see that as a sign that they've grown on me. 

Dorothea - Still no where near the top of my ranking (actually, still near the bottom) but it has become bearable. I don't skip it as often anymore.

Unfortunately, the middle of the album still falls flat for me. This includes everything from Dorothea to Cowboy Like Me. I always go straight from No Body No Crime (or Happiness) to Long Story Short.


Edit: Songs That Have Fallen 

Tis The Damn Season - When I first listened to the album, this was actually one of the ones I clicked with right away. However, I don't find myself listening to it as often anymore. I still really like it, though and it's above anything from Happiness to Cowboy Like Me.

""The delicate beginning rush / The feeling you can know so much / Without knowing anything at all / And now that I can put this down / If I had known what I'd known now / I never would've played so nonchalant""

This whole part of the song is pretty heartbreaking. Some people don't realize what they have until they're gone. It's a really easy feeling to relate too. Pretty heartbreaking too because if she hadn't played it cool, or had understood she actually had feelings for this person, they would be with her right now. In the song she does mention how she NEEDS them. 

Then there is The Last Time. All of the lyrics. Anyone can relate to that song, whether it's platonic or an intimate relationship. That's one of the songs that break me. The constant back and forth, wanting someone to value you, but they don't.

"On the point of Taylor being petty, she is. She has done multiple things that are petty in her career.

‚Ä¢the fact that she admitted that she didn‚Äôt consider the effect of re-recordings would have on the men she wrote the songs about after all these years is callous and unfair to those men.And the fact that she doesn‚Äôt attempt to stop her fans from attacking them is wrong. Especially when they didn‚Äôt even do anything bad to her with all things considered. It comes off as immature and never changing.


‚Ä¢Writing songs about men that she had been in relationships with and leaving breadcrumbs so that her fans will know who she is talking about is petty. 
I think this is the reason I hate it when people get mad because the public only talked about who she‚Äôs dating and who she has dated. Her career has been built from to be that way.

‚Ä¢Idc what anybody says but Speak Now is a petty album from its inception. Swifties always boost that she wrote the album by herself, but they left out the story about how critics were saying she didn‚Äôt do much to help write the Fearless songs, so she wrote the album by herself to prove them wrong.

For me, personally, no matter how much someone claims she is the nicest person in world, and she may be, she always came off to me as: 1. A person that only does something when it benefits themselves and 2.a person that is okay with dishing out a certain behavior until that same behavior is flipped onto them.

"I feel like this is super shitty because he's basically setting Taylor up for failure, because no matter what she does now the media is going to find a way to make her look like the bad guy. If she offers a rebuttal instead of accepting his apology, she's being petty. If she doesn't respond at all, she's being cold. If she does respond and accept his apology, he gets to look like the good guy and suddenly it's all water under the bridge, and ""NoBoDy CaN iMaGinE wHy ShE'd StIlL bE uPsEt"" it's fucking ridiculous.

This is an age old tale of women in the industry being undermined and not getting their due for doing as much, and often *more* work than their male counterparts. Like, this dude is in a mediocre indie pop band that was big 15 years ago for releasing a song that goes ""FEEL GOOD. FEEL GOOD. FEEL GOOD."" and he's making headlines for sharting out a hot take about Taylor Swift that plays into the same tired, sexist tropes that paint music made by and for women as less deep, less artistic, and less *valid* than music made by men. I am so sick of this crap.

I think more than any of Taylor‚Äôs other albums, Fearless is the easiest to come back to‚Äîevery song is filled with a certain nostalgia that you can relate to no matter what age you are, since you‚Äôre immediately in that mindset of being 15 and having your first kiss and first heartbreak and every other big teen experience.",neutral

Those ""goodbye, goodbye, goodbye""s have so much grief in her voice. It could be about something else entirely, and I don't want to speculate too much, similarly to how I felt with Forever Winter, but whatever it's about, she was brave to share her hurt in that song, and the proof is in how deeply it's speaking to people who've suffered any type of painful loss.

LWYMMD was a pretty bombastic lead single and I remember a lot of people talking about the video (albeit a lot of that talk was negative) but once she got further down the rep single rollout I don‚Äôt remember many people in the gp talking about them, maybe other than Delicate.

She uses love themes with beautiful imagery. 

She's not writing about Joe Jonas or Harry Styles. She's writing about feelings of love that she's experienced, her friends have experienced, fictional characters experienced, what she wishes she experienced. 

She writes love songs because it's the music industry, and every song is about love. As humans, we love love. Love songs aren't about specific people, they are about feelings. And those feelings can come from a lot of different place. 

Love also includes friendship, self-love, and career love. Which this album all touches on.",neutral

"This is how I feel, just not a fan of constant ballads. And unfortunately so many of the much lauded ""great"" female singers of the past several decades seem to focus on these ""power ballads"", at least in their popular singles.

That Taylor's voice might not be best suited for the power ballad has been one of her greatest assets, IMO at least. I much prefer her calming, soothing, delicate voice over loud and powerful.

Theme: A break up neither of us wanted 

Explanation: I started to date a man who was recently separated from his wife. Because they have kids and for financial reasons even though they are separated she is still pretty in his life. They were both seeing other people, but then it became too hard for her to see him date other people. At first he didn‚Äôt care, but then she started taking her frustration out on him and the kids. We broke up, but we are still friends and both of us want to be together. Make me a playlist about mourning a relationship that both of us want to continue.

Songs From Other Artists: Yes, but it should be mostly Taylor. Outside of Taylor I like Alternative, Pop, Indie Pop, and Rock so songs from those genres would work. 

Any Other Specifications: A lot of break up songs are like ‚Äúyou messed up this relationship and I‚Äôm angry‚Äù or ‚ÄúI screwed up this relationship‚Äù and here neither of those apply here. I‚Äôd love to find songs with lyrics that resonate with this situation.",neutral

"There was a time where I honestly thought Taylor was dating people for attention and then made the connection out to be more than it was in her music.

She always seemed to match with guys who were famous, would offer opportunities to be heavily visible in the public eye (even though she didn‚Äôt need that, her music was enough to keep her in superstardom), and when the relationship ended she suddenly would appear with another famous guy. 

Then, these wonderfully written songs about the grand love affairs would come out, and it honestly seemed to be nuggets of truth surrounded by fluff. I mean, ATW (shorter version) comes across like a romance for the ages, cut down tragically by second guessing. It was a 3 month relationship in reality.

"Nice Whitman reference and I agree with a lot of this. Pop is like the stepchild genre of the music industry and Taylor is the current reigning champion of the genre so she gets extra hate (no shade to other pop queens and kings, I just think she is crushing almost every metric and has for years). I have always enjoyed a decent variety of artists from different genres including classic rock and alternative, indie, folk and pop. Little hip hop and soul sometimes. I mean when a song is good you feel it and hear it, and the genre should not be so important. Clint Eastwood (Gorillaz track of Albarn‚Äôs) is a bona fide bop that I remember jamming to throughout most of 2001, and Song 2 is catchy for sure. I wish this hadn‚Äôt happened, honestly, as I felt like Taylor had made inroads with a lot of hostile listeners during the -ore eras, and now so many people will use this to help them justify their negative opinions.

"""What was your working relationship with Max Martin, who is credited as the album‚Äôs co-executive producer?

He doesn‚Äôt do interviews, so people create this Wizard of Oz-type persona because he‚Äôs seemingly so mysterious. But if you get in a room with him, he‚Äôs absolutely warm and kind and funny, and honestly, out of the goodness of his heart did so much extra work on this album and never asked to be named anything. I started to experiment and work with other people, and Max knew that I wanted to make an album, not a collection of songs that sound like they‚Äôre recorded in different studios by different people. So he volunteered to record pretty much all the vocals ‚Äî even things he didn‚Äôt write or produce. He would come in and spend his day away from his kid, away from his wife, and volunteer his time and not ask for anything. And the more that he did that, the more I realized that he deserved credit for that.

"part of me feels like 1989 is a 'safe' drop even without the physicals shipping because 1989 completely speaks for itself... like it already won all the awards and was one of the biggest pop eras ever so even if 1989 is released and is a 'flop' in the sense that only swifties care about it and the GP doesn't.... it doesn't really matter because this album has already broke records

So true, IFTYE also threw me off in a way that I think made me mad from the start.

Kinda sad that Rep is your least favourite, but that's ok, I guess that's why it's cool that Taylor plays with a lot of different sounds and genres. There's always something for everyone. I think my ranking is:

1. RED
2. Folklore
3. 1989
4. Evermore
5. Reputation
6. Lover
7. Fearless 
8. Speak Now
9. Debut.

It fluctuates tho, depending on what I'm going through or the season I guess, and Lover and Rep swap places",neutral
"Ooh fun! If I had to pick a new song for the opener on each album, it would be:

* *Teardrops on My Guitar* for *Taylor Swift*
* *Hey Stephen* for *Fearless*
* *Sparks Fly* for *Speak Now*
* *Red* for *Red*
* *Blank Space* for *1989*
* *End Game* for *reputation*
* *I Think He Knows* for *Lover*
* *cardigan* for *folklore*
* *gold rush* for *evermore*

*New Romantics* definitely perfectly encapsulates the theme of the album for me. I've always felt it would make a perfect closer.",neutral
"I see what you‚Äôre saying but personally the genre thing never bothered me. I actually like it a bout the album. Why does an album have to all be one genre? I‚Äôve always liked Red best because every song on it (well almost) is beautiful. Fearless I absolutely loved when it came out but re-listening now is cool for nostalgia but the songs are by a child for children. Excellent music about teenage love and transitions but as an adult, (as anyone who was with Taylor for the originals now is) I prefer listening to albums she wrote as an adult too. Red is wise beyond its years. Just my personal take. But understand why people see it as transitional in terms of sound.",neutral

"Didn‚Äôt Taylor say at one of the Secret Sessions that she did not know what romance really was before she started writing songs about her relationship with Joe Alwyn? Personally I think her most romantic songs are Delicate, Lover, Invisible Strings and Peace. They really tell the story of their journey together.

Delicate is about when they are just starting. Taylor is perhaps rushing in and she wants reassurance that he is okay with that. Lover is just a celebration of a solid relationship and of the joy it brings her after they have set up home together and invisible Strings is a reflection on how fate drew them together. 

Peace is such a beautiful song and one of my favourites. Taylor has sung of her insecurities often and this is another one where she writes about the enormous amount of baggage she brings to her relationship. It‚Äôs a bit of a sequel to Ready For It. She knows the sacrifices Joe has to make to be with her and she says how much she admires him. Peace is in my opinion Taylor‚Äôs most romantic song yet and she talks for the first time about having children. That is a huge thing to say to anyone and is an even bigger deal to put in a song that goes out to the world",neutral

"So as someone who is queer, and has been openly queer for many years now, I had absolutely no idea that lavender had any connections to the queer community besides pride flags until two days ago, so I find it odd that people online are acting as though lavender's connection to the queer community is something that the entire world is expected to know. 

When you google the phrase ""lavender haze"" two things come up that are unrelated to Taylor Swift, the definition Taylor based her song on, and marijuana. I can't find any link between lavender haze and the queer community specifically. When you google ""lavender"" all that comes up are results about the flower. If you get more specific with ""lavender colour"", the results are the wikipedia page for the colour, and paint swatches, and the wikipedia page does have a section in the ""in culture"" tab that talks about lavender's importance to the queer community, but it's not in the summary section. 

So while I do think that it would have been possible for someone from Taylor's team to find the connection of lavender to queer people, I don't think it's likely. Taylor says she googled the phrase lavender haze, and came across the definition, not that she was researching the actual colour lavender. Even so, if you google the word lavender by itself, you still don't get results about the colour's connection to queerness. A person would likely have to be specifically looking for connections between the colour lavender and the queer community to come across the importance.

And regardless, we haven't even heard the song yet, and as far as Taylor's explanation goes, it sounds like the song is about the phrase lavender haze specifically, not the colour. So I really don't see how Taylor would've come across the definition, and I also don't really think it's problematic to refer to a straight relationship as ""being in a lavender haze"" when that phrase doesn't have any connections to the queer community specifically, just being in love.",neutral

"""Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws, 
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night, 
(Oh!) Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright, 
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life, 
(One, two, one two three four!)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings, 
Uh huh, that's right, 
Darling, you're the one I want, and 
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this, 
Uh huh, that's right, 
Darling, you're the one I want, 
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams, 
Oh, you're the one I want""

It's either this or all of Invisible Strings.


When I met my husband, it was right after getting out of the most whirlwind, exciting, stressful and heartbreaking relationship with someone who changed my whole thoughts on marriage and family, gave me the opportunity to travel, and helped me get through some major life changes but absolutely destroyed me by the end when he neglected my needs, alluded to wanting me to get rid of my dog who's my whole world, criticized my living choices, and ended up cheating on me right when I needed the support the most. I hurt for a long time and then the first day I met my husband and got to talk to him (we worked together, so I said hi to him the day he interviewed but I really got to talk to him his first day of work) and within the first hour of getting to know him, I could hear and feel ""Begin Again"" throughout that first shift. 
We started dating 2.5 weeks after he started and we never looked back. 

Paper Rings came out and we weren't engaged yet and this became one of our songs, but so did INTHAF and Daylight, but we were so excited to get engaged and get married that this song really spoke to us. Then I heard Invisible Strings and it really felt like us, we grew up 15 minutes apart from each other, moved to the same area for school (2 different schools in the same city) at the same time and would go to the same meetup event, moved back to our hometown the same week, started the same job months only 3 months apart and I knew his mom for several years and never met him, so there was definitely some invisible string tying us together. 

We ended up marrying twice due to COVID and things throughout that time have been many long nights as my husband works full time and goes back to school for something new so we can hopefully live a better life. Every night he comes home exhausted after school and work, there's definitely multiple nights of kisses for a long night and kisses that it will be alright, but throughout it all, falling in love with him was the best accident, and I would still marry him with paper rings if it meant being with him forever. 

At our wedding pt.2, the wedding party walked down the aisle to an instrumental version of INTHAF, I walked down to an instrumental version of Begin Again, and we walked back down the aisle to an instrumental of Invisible Strings, and one of our first songs (not first dance but the song after that) was Paper Rings. 

I look forward to our next step in our relationship when this gets to be the song that relates to us:

""And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences 
Sit with you in the trenches 
Give you my wild, give you a child 
Give you the silence that only comes when two people  understand each other 
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my  brother 
Is it enough?""",neutral

Red(what Taylor called her only breakup album)- IKYWT, WANEGBT (2)

1989- blank space, shake it off, bad blood (again neither about her ex)

Reputation, lover, folklore, evermore- not about exes.


So literally 4 out of all her 'biggest hits' of the eras are about exes. But people conveniently cite other songs( which are also great songs but not her only or biggest hits) and say she a career off of exes. Just because she makes good heartbreak songs that so many people love listening to, people try to reduce her to just that while her discography easily shows otherwise.",neutral

"Until I see evidence otherwise, I have to believe that Taylor‚Äôs team and whoever is making decisions about merch are somewhat disconnected.  I think there is probably some involvement from Taylor or her team on some items, such as the arcade ring or the fearless key necklace.  But I think it‚Äôs fully possible the 1989 summer merch drop got put out to make money on a summer Taylor aesthetic, and was never put in front of anyone who would be able to figure out fans would see it as a ‚Äú1989 is next‚Äù hint.  We‚Äôve seen the cheap materials, ridiculous delays, and lazy work done on the merch...  whoever is in charge doesn‚Äôt seem to care about Taylor Swift‚Äôs music very much.

I wish all the Swifties could open a factory where we‚Äôd make vinyls, plus all other official merch for Taylor.  Everything would be done with care and attention, and vinyls wouldn‚Äôt need to be delayed so long after album releases.  We would make sure to keep producing merch that there is still demand for, to keep all these resellers from making money on things like cardigans, blankets, etc.... and create partnerships with sellers creating amazing merch on Etsy, etc like all the pins, keychains, jewelry...  if only.",neutral

Like recently I saw a post about someone losing their husband unexpectedly and I started kind of spiraling about how I would even function if that happened to me. The song is sad but it feels like that to me, this exploration of a potential painful reality you hope never happens.",neutral

"Here's a few reasons why I personally think we will get an announcement soon (and I'm not necessarily saying this *week* but like this month and probably in the early half of it):

 - I'm assuming she is going to do two per year, based purely on what happened last year. That means the next one will probably come out in the early half of this year, my guess would be May 13th but maybe that's too obvious. That means that sometime in March is probably a decent time to announce to give a couple of months lead up.

- Red TV was announced was announced 23 days after the last Fearless TV chapter. I think last week was gonna be 26 days after the last Red TV chapter so that timing lines up.

- 3/4/2022 adds up to 13 so like, why not?

So basically just the timings because, let's be real, if you try hard enough a lot of dates add up to 13 lol",neutral

"Pretty sure Taylor has said that folklore and evermore style wise and sound wise is the most her thing she‚Äôs ever done. She wore her own clothes for the Photoshoot and wrote the songs she wanted without worrying about if they could be played on the radio. So if she wants to keep in this direction she should. She shouldn‚Äôt have to change who she is, what she wears, and what she wants to sing just for the sake of entertaining us. If she decides she wants to get back into country I think she should. I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at it I love country music. I would love her to make a western inspired album. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hear a mainstream sounding country album from her. If she decides to go back to country I hope she chooses one of the sub-genres. Also as a big country fan the political climate and looked over racism in mainstream country music mostly caused by country music fans right now is really messed up. I don‚Äôt think Taylor would want to get caught up in all that. It‚Äôs not just about the music anymore which is what Taylor wants.",neutral

She took some risks with this album marketing wise and it paid off. It helps that the album is really good and maybe her most mature work to date.",neutral

"I wouldn't be surprised if she had originally intended to announce 1989 TV on the day she announced Red TV (üõ¥'s birthday). Gathering speculation from other comments, I'm guessing while re-recording 1989 there were unforseen hiccups and her date to release had to be pushed back significantly. I think this is the most likely scenario given the 1989 themed summer merch and previous easter eggs hinting at 1989. They probably already had all their merch lined up for this summer a while back (before they even saw 1989 not being ready in time), and what are they gonna do just sit on all this summer merch and store it in a warehouse because they are not ready to release the album? Basically shooting themselves in the foot PR wise because things didn't go to plan and being forced to sell the 1989 summer merch as it is the most economical thing to do (and will cost them less money).

She's probably known all this for a while which is why we can see a shift in the ""hints"" being let out (see her tweet with 4 red hearts knowing Fearless TV is symbolized with 2 gold hearts). I don't think it is a big deal for her to release Red next, since it doesn't come out till November and it's a fall themed album anyway. As someone else said, I think she's always planned on Red coming out then, but didn't want to announce it until after 1989 had it's run in the summer months.",neutral

"New Years Day!

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there if you‚Äôre the toast of the town babe, or if you strike out and you‚Äôre crawling home‚Äù 

This is the song on rep that made me realise Joe and Taylor were the real deal.

It‚Äôs so romantic! it perfectly captures that feeling of unconditional love and willing to be vulnerable with someone and accepting their vulnerabilities. 

""I was thinking about how everybody talks and thinks about who you kiss at midnight But I think there's something even more romantic about who's gonna deal with you on New Year's Day. Who's willing to give you Advil and clean up the house? I think that states more of a permanence.""

"Yeah I like that Taylor blends pieces from different genres, and at the core of these songs are her talent for songwriting. 

I think anybody that can appreciate the tradition of singer-songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan) can see the talent in Taylor‚Äôs writing and singing. 

I was a James Taylor fan before Taylor Swift. He‚Äôs who her parents named her after. And seeing her perform live with him had an impact of me listening to more of her music. 

What‚Äôs especially smart about Taylor is for her new albums (folklore and evermore) she brought on the biggest (if not one of) modern indie folkster in Bon Iver. The claims of ‚ÄúTaylor pretending to be folk/indie‚Äù went right out the window with the co-sign of Bon Iver in her music, though let me be clear she shouldn‚Äôt *have* to do this. And doubt it was her primary reason. Haters gonna hate regardless tho.

I think people see the image of her in media affect their opinions of the music itself. She‚Äôs more than just a pop star.",neutral

Sure, there will be some fans that will always take it too far but as someone who has spoken consistently about the impact of being publicly shamed on her wellbeing, she should definitely speak up.

"I'll be honest, and I say this with the caveat that every Taylor show I've been to was amazing - but for me, 1989 was by far her worst tour of the ones I've seen (which is all of them except Fearless).

This may be in part because 1989 is my least favorite album, but I found the set list really boring. The standout songs were the songs from Red (which she performed in more of a rock/metal style), and the Enchanted/Wildest Dreams mashup and OOTW (which, to be fair, is one of my favorite live moments ever). Other than that, the setlist just all kind of ran together with the songs all sounding the same. I also really didn't like the costumes for this tour. And unlike other tours, she didn't play many songs from past albums and she didn't switch up the surprise songs every night; she just alternated YBWM and Fifteen for the most part. She also didn't utilize her band much; it was mostly just backing tracks that sounded more or less exactly like the album.

At the end of the day, it was still a Taylor show and thus still amazing. But it's my least favorite of her tours. rep tour blew it out of the water.",neutral

"I used to be a huge Speak Now/Red fan back in 2012/2013. When 1989 was released I quickly lost interest (wasn't into pop music as much at the time) even though I still appreciated Blank Space and Style. 1989 Taylor just looked too polished to me, so I couldn't really connect with her. I absolutely loved the cheekiness of Look What You Made Me Do when it came out and even had it on repeat for a few months, but that wasn't enough to draw me back.

"I think, for all artists, there‚Äôs been an overall decrease in album excitement and longevity in recent years. I feel like our attention spans have gotten shorter, so we get hype over one thing and then quickly move on to the next shiny object. 

For Taylor, it probably doesn‚Äôt help that she‚Äôs released (re-released) so many albums in such a short period of time and is hinting toward more coming soon. It takes away from the current album when fans are already expecting the next one. You can see it in this sub by how many people were excited for Midnights, but as soon as Bejeweled dropped, the conversation switched to Speak Now.

"I mentioned yesterday on here that I was having a meh day. Today has been a lot better! I'm in a much better mental state than I have been in the past few days. It's been wet today, and as someone seeing the outside through a window, I've been really loving it. Rain always soothes me, I find it so calming! Today has been chill and really relaxing for me. And also resetting. Today I looked in the mirror and felt really good about who I saw in it. Whereas yesterday I certainly did not. I always pull myself down and get so critical over the tiniest of details. Like my jawline. Odd, I know. Some days I really love how I look, and others I feel as if I have the jawline of a frog. Nothing about me has changed between yesterday and today, only my perception of myself. I just feel good today, I feel real happy. I don't know if this qualifies as over-sharing, but I really wanted to share how I was feeling, and maybe tell someone they're not alone in having a sucky day. &lt;3

I really appreciate y'all (:",neutral

On one of the recent Ringer Dish they pointed out the difference between Joe and some of her previous partners &amp; that Joe wanted away from the limelight whereas others (they used Hiddlestone example) might have wanted to be alongside her in paparazzi shots.

"I am opposite of you, actually. I at first found the first half of the song pretty but bland in the context of all the other songs on the album.

By the time I got back up to my bff, Taylor had fully opened the show. I was cool with that. It was noisy and there were a lot of stairs to get back up, because of course my bestie didn‚Äôt even hear her phone in her pocket and I couldn‚Äôt remember where our seats were lol. üòÇ

And then I couldn‚Äôt settle down for awhile, and I kept trying to talk to her as loudly as I could because I had the whole album memorized backwards and forwards and I‚Äôve never cared much about live music. 

I think when Taylor got down into the crowd and WALKED LIKE JESUS/MOSES PARTING THE FUCKING SCREAMING AND BEDAZZLED SEA OF POTENTIAL MURDERERS  (üòÇ) AND I COULD STILL *HEAR* the vibrations of the stadium and all I could think was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI remember Reddit saying that Andrea Swift basically hand selects anyone who meets Taylor after the concert. I‚Äôm really pissed that I know that but I didn‚Äôt think ahead and make sure I bought the tickets for the concert instead of the plane tickets, so I could‚Äôve gotten us closer to the front.‚Äù 

Cuz by the time Taylor was (definitely *pretending* that she was smiling and laughing and touching as many hands, of as many fans as she could, in the largest sold out stadium tour in North America, around *Mother‚Äôs Day*, (and I only remember that because I glanced at the set-list a few hours before the concert and saw that the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù song for our night was gonna be The Best Day, which was always an eyeroll song for me, haha‚Ä¶)

I was days and days behind. We didn‚Äôt have to be at the front! Andrea Swift is smarter than *that*, by ~~now~~ then, haha. 

I would‚Äôve spent the whole concert finding Andrea in the crowd and being the calm and chill grownup fan who maybe hasn‚Äôt gotten to meet Taylor before. Cuz Andrea Swift won‚Äôt be around forever, and that‚Äôs just life. 

But god dammit if my biggest regret in life, so far, at least lol, is that I didn‚Äôt spend that whole damn concert bumping my best friend around the crowd. She‚Äôs the one who deserved to meet Taylor that night; I‚Äôd spent all of 2016 in radio silence and just cruising around the Internet like I always have, haha. And I was just‚Ä¶interested in the experience. 

So, to answer your question, *my* answer is already in the universe somewhere. I don‚Äôt have to ask Taylor anything cuz she‚Äôs just a person. üòÖü•∞ Her fans who are fans, and that‚Äôs it, also know that. 

But signed, sealed, and delivered; my phone number never changes. And I‚Äôm awfully good at just observing and taking notes, just because I guess? Lol. That‚Äôs my brain for ya. So one day in the future, maybe I‚Äôm already at Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs next tour date with a young fan who just really loves her music, okay?? GAWD. Haha. 

And it‚Äôs my job to keep track of *that* future young fan and their excitement to meet their favorite artist for the first time, even if it‚Äôs *gasp* backstage!! That‚Äôs really fun to fans around the world. 

But by then, I‚Äôll be even more elderly and imma be sweating my ass off wondering ‚Äúokay do I have enough pictures for Soybean and/or Gruesome or WHOEVER, Jesus there‚Äôs too many kids at this concert but whatever; to at least be able to let them say ‚ÄúYEAH, I was THERE YOU GUYS, I‚Äôll prove it to you *right now omg*‚Äù (^YNTCD)‚Ä¶üòÇü•πüòò

Taylor and Andrea were the mother/daughter dream team that turned out strangely successful. It‚Äôs just ‚Äúancient‚Äù history from here/there, as Dr. Suess might say, lol. Rhyme is not without reason. 

I just came up with that one ^^ and yeah, if I could go back in time, I definitely would‚Äôve just‚Ä¶already handed Andrea Swift a playbill from the concert and asked her if she could have Taylor sign that real quick for my friend after they had a few minutes to just be tired but upbeat adults after a really exhausting night, right?? Right. Haha. 

Cuz I‚Äôve heard tell that Taylor is super generous with stuff like‚Ä¶using her mom as her therapist and never telling anyone; for years and years, as she herself would say, lol. And that works because she‚Äôs Taylor Fuckin‚Äô Swift, haha. Her mom is apparently the 6th sense mastermind behind knowing even *which fans randomly selected from the largest crowd her daughter has ever exposed herself to in her entire career of live performances* and she might just‚Ä¶be the most person making the most important 50/50 of someone‚Äôs life that night. 

Even if it was just something like a marriage proposal for a couple that is now forever immortalized on the internet with Taylor Swift in the background just being Taylor Swift. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø üòù

Tl:dr means too long; didn‚Äôt read. I ‚Äúcode-switch‚Äù things like acronyms because my brain gets real tired. I have, and this isn‚Äôt any weird exaggerated story lol, have needed to call my own mother from time to time in my life for something as basic as remembering my entire damn SSN instead of just the last 4 digits.

"i go back to the thought that she has to space out the rerecordings through january 2023 (assuming not much work NEEDS to be done to rep since it is so fresh), and it would be really not smart marketing for the next two to be red and 1989. she would lose steam for fringe swifties to buy into debut and speak now to release them after her two commercially biggest albums. the interest would wane immensely. 

estimated timeline:
- summer 2021 - 1989 (we can believe in this because of the wildest dreams rerecord for movie promo)
- fall 2021 - speak now
- spring 2022 - debut
- late summer/fall 2022 - red
- winter 2023 - rep

this also leaves room for her to drop TS10 this winter. girl gave us a LOT of content in 2020 and we need to not expect that pace for all her subsequent new music. she was b o r e d and as things ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù she is going to be able to focus on other projects as well, likely putting her back on a more predictable recording schedule (not that she needs one, as she‚Äôs made it clear she‚Äôll record and drop what she wants when she wants now).",neutral

Taylor didn't have any say in how public this whole situation turned out.  She's a musician not an influencer or reality tv star.  She prefers to be out of the public eye.  But through Kims actions, Taylor had to face consequences for something she had every right to speak her mind against.

"I was often accused of having an ED for much of my teens and 20s because of my body type and all it did was make me self-conscious and wear baggy clothes to avoid commentary (basically what Billie Eilish is doing now). I believe Taylor expressed a desire in not being body positive, but ""body neutral"" where she really doesn't want people talking about her body at all and I can really get behind that. Even the most well-meaning people cannot comment on her current body without implying that there was something ""wrong"" with her past body. Our minds tend to focus on negative criticism, so you never stop hearing what is ""wrong"", so it's best to just.. not say anything at all.  

I also think it's not a great idea to perpetuate the idea that there is a specific *look* associated with ED because many of those I know who suffered from ED are not considered slim. It makes it a lot harder for people to recognize there is something wrong and get the help they need if there's a general cognitive bias that says only underweight = ED.

Speak Now: LONG LIVE. Is it already a fan favorite? Yeah. Has it gotten its moment in a lot of ways? Yeah. Should it still be the focal point of Speak Now (Taylor's Version)? YEAH.

1989: I don't know, this is the hardest one for me. I Know Places, maybe? With a dark fuck-the-paparazzi video. A reminder that the 1989 era wasn't all fun and games.

What I love about Feist is that she makes indie-folk music, but she often manages to make it rock. Songs like ""Centuries"", ""The Bad In Each Other"", and ""A Commotion"" are great examples of this. 

If you don't know who Feist is, you might remember her 2007 hit ""1234"" with the music video that was featured in that iPod Nano commercial.",neutral

One of the producers who worked on the Willow '90s trend remix was supposedly working on TS10 and kept leaking info about it. He's now supposedly been fired for leaking and is blaming Swifties for getting fired. He went on an angry rant and concluded that TS10 is coming January 2022.

"So an open-shut case is a case where there are no reasonable doubts or really any dispute. You know from the beginning how it's gonna turn out. In the context Taylor is using, is, if this was an open-shut case, if this was simple, clear cut and dry from the very beginning, she wouldn't have known simply because the look on his face was so confusing and as Taylor likes to describe the song, ""witchy."" Like someone was casting a spell on her. So basically she's saying if was supposed to be easy, she would've never known from the way he's...influencing her and making her feel.

""Every bait and switch was a work of art"" - once again, continuing on with this ""witchy"" spell casting sort of vibe. Bait and switch, (also things in fishing), is a way of luring someone in with something, (in this case, love), and then the cost of that, being more than it's worth. In this case, she's saying all those times he lured her in and she fell for it, it was beautiful. She wrote this song with the concept of someone casting a spell on her, so that's what she's doing here!

That time together is more important than any amount of money, number one singles or calls for live music from the fans.

I‚Äôd be perfectly content if every single album release after this is a surprise drop, one music video and a ‚Äòlong pond‚Äô type live performance that will put her in our living rooms instead of Taylor having to be in a stadium 1000s of miles away from Andrea when she needs her.

I really, truly hope that Andrea gets to see Taylor become a mom (as long as that is what Taylor wants) before anything tragic happens.

It‚Äôs really easy to call someone problematic until that label sticks, regardless of the underlying justification. 

The linked articles do a better job of explaining, but basically it‚Äôs *possible* she and her conservationist husband (it seems mostly her husband?) was involved in the shooting of an elephant poacher in 1995 in Zambia, and the Zambian government wants to question her about the incident. And that‚Äôs she‚Äôs written characters who display racist behavior, which seems to be condemned in the book?

"It's a great track, just doesn't fit the whole track 5 thing. I honestly think track 5s were ruined when she found out the previous ones were fan favorites. Don't get me wrong but after All Too Well, my tears ricochet is the first track 5 sounding track 5. 

AYHTDWS, delicate, and The Archer are all good songs but vulnerability wasn't the only thing that made her track 5s stand out. They were REALLY sad and heartbreaking and before my tears ricochet they were about actual heartbreak from relationships. AYHTDWS is about heartbreak, yes, but like most people are saying it's not a ballad. 

Lyrically, it all falls short of being a track 5 imo simply for the fact that the words are too . . . straight forward. All track 5s before it had more poetic lyrics, shall I say.

Delicate kinda kinda feels the same. It's a great track, but it didn't feel like a track 5 to me. It's not heartbreaking, it's more hopeful, really, albeit a fragile kind of home hence the title. Delicate has the vulnerability, lyrics are great but still too simple, for lack of a better word, to actually feel like s track 5.

The Archer is both vulnerable and poetic enough, again lacking a better word here hahaha. But it's more vulnerable than sad, letting a person see you, through you. But it's similar to delicate in a way, it's also hopeful in a way especially with the last line. It's sad, but I don't really think it's heartbreaking.

Now, my tears ricochet that's more track 5 to me. I think it has all the ingredients that drew people to previous track 5s. It's not about a break up but it's just as heartbreaking as All Too Well or Dear John.

Those are my thoughts hahaha. AYHTDWS IS a great track, but I just don't think it's a good track 5. To be honest, I don't think 1989 has a good track 5 candidate. It's just too . . . pop. But again, this is just how it is for me. Also, I don't have an opinion on tolerate it.

"Speak Now isn‚Äôt underrated within the fandom, but with the GP it might be. 
There wasn‚Äôt really a huge, era defining hit with that album. All the singles did relatively well, but it didn‚Äôt really do anything for Taylor other than cement what a great songwriter she was. 

I think because a lot of the songs had that country/pop rock vibe, it didn‚Äôt do as well because she released it around the time we were seeing a huge dance craze take over with the likes of Katy, Gaga, Kesha etc, where as Taylor‚Äôs sound in Speak Now was more popular in the mid 2000s with the likes of Kelly Clarkson and Avril and Paramore. 

With regards to giving it the same hype as RED, does anyone else think she‚Äôs trying a different approach to Fearless to see which works better? Like with Fearless, she released some tracks in the lead up but then once the album was out, she just let it do it‚Äôs thing. 
With Red, she‚Äôs released nothing (to hopefully build maximum hype) and has a string of promo slots and a music video/film lined up. I think she‚Äôs trying this approach to see whether it‚Äôs worth going all out for the next re-recordings or not.",neutral

There's not a single skip for me, and it's cohesive yet each song has its own personality. You can hear elements of each era in the album, but it also has its own unique vibe.

"I‚Äôm same way. We‚Äôll get an announcement next Thursday.  I assume it will be 1989 based on F1RST theory but a lot has happened since she posted those Instagram pictures. Finding the folklorian forest has changed Taylor‚Äôs vision of her future so maybe F1RST has been scrapped like Lover tour.   She knows now she doesn‚Äôt have to do 2 year album cycles and can write songs that don‚Äôt require her to expose herself to criticism and analysis.  She likes surprise drops for new albums now because she‚Äôs learned long run ups are not necessary for her like they are for emerging artists.  A short run up for the re-record is a good idea to build interest to make sure they do well for first week sales which sets the tone that re-records are working.  It‚Äôll be 1989 or woodvale not both this month because she still runs a business that has people who need to be paid.  But like you I think 1989 is most likely to put pressure on the current owners of her old masters to sell them to her without strings. Also, every re-record she releases reduces the price current owners can ask for the older masters especially if she has already finished the re-records and just needs to release them.",neutral

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about monetization. I think when taylor does something, she wants it to be her best quality work.

She created an entire 2hr documentary showcasing the writing process of folklore with both of the producers present and a high quality performance you can watch over and over. Most people already have a Disney + subscription (and if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs only like $7 and it gives you a free week trial) and this method allows fans to watch the show in HD, over and over again on their TVs instead of just on a tiny phone screen where you have to find other people‚Äôs screen recordings to watch the show again.

So for them to be credited this late is the reason most people think is a bit weird, specially when Dan and Olivia said that the only inspiration is the harmonized yells and the song doesn‚Äôt really sound like Cruel Summer at all. 

Also there‚Äôs a reason why The Rolling Stones article says that Deja Vu didn‚Äôt use a sample or interpolation so I believe maybe they only credited them to shut people up about the accusations Olivia was getting which in my opinion they were ridiculous, every artist takes inspiration from another artist, many songs sound the same and that doesn‚Äôt mean is a copy. A couple of songs Taylor has sound like Hilary Duff songs, same with Elvis Costello so this whole debacle about ‚Äúplagiarism‚Äù in music is just ridiculous.",neutral

"It wasn't hugely successful at all. The common argument that it was a big hit is that it hit #2 and would of been #1 if it wasn't for one of the biggest songs of all time(Old Town Road) and those are true facts.  

However it was a Taylor Swift lead single with alot of promotion - that's always going to chart well no matter the song, it had a massive fall after the first week, had no longevity at all and only spent 3 weeks in the Top 10 which is terrible for a lead from an artist of Taylor's level, she had to edit the song with literal silence because people hated a line so much, it had the single worst callouts of the year and only spent a single week inside radio Top 10. 

This very subreddit also voted it as the worst song off of Lover and one of her worst songs ever, I have no problem with anyone who likes the song, taste is subjective and I'm sure I have plenty of songs that I like that others don't, but I do think it was a missed opportunity and started the era off on the wrong foot.",neutral

I took a semester off in Spring 2011 for mental health reasons. I bought Speak Now from Target and would listen to it while driving around town feeling depressed. I felt so powerless at this time, and like I couldn't share how I was feeling, and here was a young woman my age singing about exactly how she felt, even if it meant telling powerful men that they hurt her.

One thing I would like more is the behind of the creative process.

Then it was revealed and I'm like, duh, of course. No wonder I loved them so much!

PS this would be a really fun game and I wish it were possible to play! I think that as she progresses in her career she will end up writing more for others. She clearly doesn't seem to be running out of ideas or material any time soon.",neutral
"I‚Äôm kinda confused about what you expected to see from her? Did you just want her to stand in on place the whole show and sing?? 

The 90mins thing seems weird to me cause all the shows I went to were much longer than that. Maybe it was shortened because it was in Berlin idk???

Also Taylor has always been really good at connecting with her audience. She has you wear the light up bracelets so she can ‚Äúsee‚Äù everyone. She talks about her songs. She introduces herself and her crew. She talks about herself. Have you seen the rep tour on Netflix? She is super connected to that audience. The whole reason I cried when I saw the RED tour was because she started talking to the audience.

"Yes. I agree with all of this.
 Tbh I don't care about the release date I am happy with anything. Just happy that I can listen to it when  it's out.
But i agree i don't think this was planned by her. Swifties really took it way too far imo. Like some of u are so impatient. She gave us 3 albums in less than a YEAR geez. Some of u might start to appreciate that more like it's not like we are waiting for an album for 3 years.
I just think she released it cuz she wanted to shut us up or she didn't want to disappoint us. Mayne RED TV was really planned to be released all along but I don't think that she would release it this long before if it wasn't for the impatient fans. I think she would have released a single 2 months before tha album drop like fearless tv. 
Y'all rerecording takes time and if u want them to be in good quality u have to wait a little longer. Also she will probably space them out cuz it's better for her that way and also cuz of rep.

Edit:  Sometimes we expect so much from her, give her a break. Be happy, grateful and glad tha she has been blessing us with music nonstop this past 2 years and pls stop complaining if she doesn't drop anything in just a few months.",neutral

"If I was picking just one to keep... I guess, it wouldn't always necessarily be my favourite, or the one I thought was best. Maybe more about keeping a balance?

**Debut** \- *Our Song*

*Should've Said No* is my favourite and was very close, but I think *Our Song* is just the epitome of old country Taylor, and we have to preserve it.

**Fearless** \- *Fifteen*

I think what this song does is so precious and important and I have to preserve it. It *is* one of my favourites, too. She's talked about friendship and \~reflections on teenagehood\~ a few times now, but I think this is the purest and most beautiful iteration.

**Speak Now** \- *Dear John*

Couldn't take this out of the world. Obviously I don't know much about anyone else's experience, but I think it's incredibly powerful. Her most meaningful break-up song in my opinion. It's so empowering and important.

**Red** \- *All Too Well*

Means too much to too many people not to choose it.

**1989** \- *Blank Space*

My stan song, so I pretty much had to choose it.

**reputation** \- *Delicate*

This is not only my favourite song on the album (and my second favourite Taylor song ever) but I think this synthesises the two main themes of the album perfectly. It's also somehow instantly relatable to so many people despite being about such a specific situation. It's also just, you know, perfect.

**Lover** \- *Lover*

I adore this album and there are sooo many great candidates but it would be a bit rude to rob so many people of their wedding song.

**folklore** \- *the lakes*

This song just has a very special personal meaning to me.

**evermore** \- *cowboy like me*

I think this is one of her best written songs ever. It's also got that awesome guitar solo. It's happy but also calm, and I think most of Taylor's happy songs are quite high-energy? Anyway, I'm pretty much just picking this one because I like it so much, but hey...

**Non-album** \- *Ronan*

This is hard because they're all so different! But this one has had such a positive impact in the world, and it's also one of her best ever, in my opinion.",neutral

"Problem is that most of the things people think are Easter eggs are not.  I'd say anything that is not said by Taylor Swift personally shouldn't be analyzed that much.   And even on Taylor's communications most are probably not an Easter egg.  And if they are Easter eggs, most are not going to be known until after the reveal.  Like the CST and Morganna stuff from this weekend.  There might be something there and speculate if you want but try not to invest too much into an individual theory.  I think for the moment most of the clothes/hair clues can be disregarded because she isn't going to change her style completely ever week.

And especially now,  look at things from what makes sense for Taylor Swift the brand.  She is in full re-record mode so TS10 is not likely to happen.  She wants evermore to win a Grammy and other awards if she can so she will do actions to make that happen.  She wants the re-records to be successful at devaluing the originals so they will sound the same.  Each will have its own release cycle(s) to push them to number 1 so she gets the positive headlines and sales.  They are likely to have a later week where she stacks things like she did with evermore for that additional #1 album week.  She makes most of her money touring so that is probably going to start happening next year.  She might want to put out TS10 then to prepare for tour.  Or maybe she won't because she'll have probably had 7 #1 albums/re-records in 1.5 years to choose from and that's not including Lover which she hasn't done either.  Then early 2023 Reputation TV will be released.

Starting next year, I don't even think Taylor knows where she'll go musically and what kind of timelines she will do but the next year seems almost fully planned out.  Maybe she'll release albums every 6 months or maybe every year.  Now that she feels comfortable writing fictional songs, I would assume the 2 year cycle is over.  But as long as she's able she'll spend a fair amount of her time touring because that's good for business.",neutral

"I've been a fan for several years and own one piece of official clothing, from the concert I attended. This discussion is super nuanced and for regular folk it aint black and white, there's a whooole lot of grey area, and that's the case for most people when trying to uproot and better any form of capitalism. Asking everyone to do everything (in this case, boycott her merch/exclusives altogether) isn't ever gonna work, but asking everyone to do SOMETHING or what they can - that \*will\* make a difference. So if people overall can buy less of this poorly made merch (i.e. only buying what they LOVE, and refraining from panic buying or buying multiples of one item, setting themselves a clear limit etc.), or seek alternatives where possible, that will make a big dent compared to asking a very rabid fanbase to buy no official merch altogether - cos that's never gonna happen. If we all lessened our impact substantially and made it known what values we do want from her merch, her store will adapt because like any business they will go where the profit is.

Many of us here live in ultra capitalist societies that don't align with our own politics or values, and so whilst still living within that society, you have to find a way to retain your values whilst ultimately living your life without stressing yourself out too much/allowing yourself to still have enjoyment. That's where the grey area comes into play, and ofc it applies to everything in a capitalist society, not just Taylor's merch store haha. For example, I seek out independent coffee shops over chains, because I'd rather my money goes into local businesses, however I do love a Starbucks PSL, so in autumn I'll probably have a few of those over the season. Compared to how much I buy from independent stores over the year, this is a tiny fraction - it's a treat for me whilst still being able to vote with my wallet for the kind of businessses I want to see thrive.

I hope that makes some sense! It's hard having these kind of discussions on a reddit page haha.",neutral

"You aren't dumb, and I'm sorry you are going through this.

Weather is typically something whose changes are more short term (as opposed to climate). Writers, especially Taylor, tend to use it as a metaphor for emotions. So I think she meant something along the lines of ""In relationships we go through difficult things like emotional turmoil (weather) and changes in our live circumstance (time). We can make plans on how we will adapt our relationship to short term problems and we can plan how our relationship will change and shift as we grow up and mature, but I was prepared for those challenges. I was not prepared for you to just abandon the relationship"".",neutral

I am passionate about this topic. Taylor stopped playing I'd Lie and never spoke of it again after that whole thing. There is no way she's going to release I'd Lie now.

1. Reputation
2. Evermore
3. Folklore
4. 1989
5. Fearless
6. Red
7. Speak Now
8. Lover
9. Debut

Some background: 1989 has nostalgically been my least favorite for years, so the fact that I rank it where it is now is a huge deal for me. Also Lover was my favorite album of hers, even after Folklore came out last year, so this change was even bigger.

Taylor‚Äôs smart and knows how to market and I‚Äôm grateful for everything we‚Äôve gotten in the last year but it feels really weird that we‚Äôve known about Red TV for months and we might only get a single or two a couple weeks before it comes out.

The only boy that she could ever find herself being with is her father's merchant, who has also been her childhood friend growing up in the palace, however, she knows that her father would never let them be together, plus she thinks that he'll never return her affections. During one of the balls, the theme is a masquerade, and a stranger asks her to dance. She senses that she's met him before, and that his eyes seem familiar behind the mask. They waltz and talk together, and she grows infatuated him. However, afterwards, he tells her that he must head off early, and that he hopes to see her again. She spends the next little while constantly thinking about him, and tells her father's merchant/friend all about him and how she'll try to discover his true identity at the next ball. Little does she know, that the masked stranger who asked her to dance was really her friend disguised.

"Probably very unpopular opinion:

*Mean*'s ""I bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold / but the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road"" makes no sense in a song where Taylor goes on to say the person is a liar, pathetic, alone in life, and also a drunk -- all of which are pretty... mean.

I am fully aware of the backstory of the song, why she might want to include those details, etc.  But through the first two verses, the song is about how someone's meanness made Taylor feel -- and even does a good job walking the line of explaining that they criticized a flaw she's already aware of, and how she has vowed to use this meanness as inspiration to achieve even greater things.

It's even fine if she wants to call this person names (I don't think it's what the song set you up for thus far, but it's an understandable coping mechanism), but that line changes the tone to feel holier-than-thou and makes the bridge totally hypocritical. You can't say ""see, I won't become you because I'm better than that"" AND have the name-calling, even if you feel it's justified -- that's exactly what the mean person did to her.  

Always made me cringe that the song was framed as an ""anti-bullying anthem.""",neutral

"But criticism isn‚Äôt always ‚Äútearing someone down.‚Äù Engaging with the meaning of her work and disagreeing with some of the ideas she advocates for within her work is not tearing her down.

The song is not simply a recount of sexism she has experienced, and the experience of sexism isn‚Äôt what is being criticized. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Taylor writing about her own experiences, and not writing about the experiences of poc. Im not sure how best to explain what I mean here, but intersectionality is not just presenting the experiences of others alongside your own.

The other factor is LWYMMD is a statement that that speaks to broader issues than IDSB, which is pretty much just about her romantic relationships if you actually look at the lyrics.

"The thing I like more about ""fucked in the head"" is that way that you can tell that the people in the song are the very Proper kind (I actually picture it as being set in the 1950s for some reason) and if they were talking about someone with mental health issues they would use some kind of euphemism.

"She‚Äôs always had ‚Äúalbum-artist energy‚Äù to me. Early on in her career her personal life would be marketed in a way which made her seem interesting to people which imo prompted them to listen to her entire albums rather than just the singles. As someone who‚Äôs been to two of her tour shows I also think that she makes her music very personal at them, largely because she spends so much time in her shows talking to the crowd. I‚Äôve been to a lot of other concerts and the one person who has maybe talked as much as her during a show was Conan Gray. For this reason I cannot fully agree that she lets the music talk for itself at her shows because she provides a good number of sort of ‚Äúmonologue-esque‚Äù transitions at her shows which give a sort of general context to each song, but it certainly does speak for itself on her albums.",neutral

"Oh, this is such a good question! As a collector, I love to hear how others organize their physical music.

I‚Äôll preface this by saying that I only collect the US versions of her physical albums, and I‚Äôm slowly getting into collection albums that she‚Äôs featured on.

In general, I group each format (CD, vinyl, cassette) in the order the albums were initially released (Debut, Christmas, Beautiful Eyes, Fearless, etc.), and I count the TVs as separate releases. So, in my collection, Fearless  TV is after Evermore.

Some of her earlier CDs were rereleased at a later time/ during other eras; those are all in order with the main album. For example, the deluxe and reissued versions of Debut were released after the initial release of her Christmas album, but I keep all of the debut CDs together.

For CDs, things get a little trickier when it comes to singles, odd-shaped albums, and signed/promo albums. Singles are stored in the order they were released. Odd-shaped albums (Red Zinepak, Lover journals, etc.) are stored where they fit. The singed and promo copies are in a separate section, in the order of the albums‚Äô releases.

For vinyl albums, I sort them in album release order, with RSDs behind the standard issue. 12‚Äù singles are filed behind their respective albums, and 7‚Äù are stored separately, in the order the singles were historically released.

The few features that I have are stored at the very end of my collection, in the order the albums were historically released

I would guess she newly recorded it. The sound quality of the rehearsal tape would probably be bad for a variety of reasons and would maybe be iffy legally to be included in the re-recordings since it would come from before she was allowed to re-record.

"I think 1989 and reputation are going to be the hardest ones since the other ones used mostly real instruments that could be easily played again, but when you add virtual instruments or processed samples it gets much more difficult. 

In a Jack Antonoff Sound On Sound interview: *"" Given the secrecy surrounding Swift‚Äôs Reputation album, Antonoff kept his studio computer offline in order to avoid an online hack and leak such as the one Madonna suffered during the making of her Rebel Heart album in 2014. ‚ÄúI¬†don‚Äôt keep anything on me,‚Äù he stresses. ‚ÄúOnce it‚Äôs done and it‚Äôs mixed and mastered, I¬†kind of want to wait until it comes out, so I¬†just wipe everything.

"I always thought Willow was a messy song lyrically, which is a shame because I love the production/melody, but it doesn't flow right for me the way I feel it needs to. You have the wandering in the woods imagery (which connects to the title, obviously) and the ship coming in to port, so you feel like you're on an emotional journey as well as a literal/physical one.

But then you have these overdone phrases that link to crime and punishment theme, 'bait and switch' 'open shut case' and the '90's trend' line which is more of a link back to reputation.

I think with a lot of folklore/evermore songs there is too much of a tendency to go back to old ideas and not fully exploring new concepts which holds her back, and yes she does rely too much on oft use phrases/imagery as you said. Also stars/scars, she uses 'hurt' too many times without actually explaining the specific emotion. 'Sit here in this hurt' 'waves of hurt' sound too generic for Taylor Swift songwriting.",neutral

I know that‚Äôs the usual reaction from swifties when I‚Äôm not die hard fan of evermore. I understand you who love all of these songs and I love em to.

The lyrics are way better on evermore though.,neutral
"I just saw committothebrit's tik tok and my thinking so far is: what bullshit arguments. Coming in as a surprise to NO ONE, Hall and Butler's lawyers suck.

From what I understood, they're trying to argue that they have stading because the copyrights law apparently doesn't cover the transference of rights to sue for infrigment in cases with more than one copyright owner, therefore Universal and Sony can't be the owners of those rights even thought they SIGNED A CONTRACT transfering those rights to these companies... They're trying to take Universal and Sony off of the plaintiff equation.

It'd be such a better argument if they said Universal and Sony had conflict of interests to sue, and therefore Hall and Butler should be allowed to sue (committothebrit said that this could be their argument in other videos), and that argument itself would be a reach. Their lawyers are so bad that even a swiftie lawyer, who opposes the plaintiffs case, comes up with a better argument for their case...

There's a good side to that, at least: with this response, it'll be really hard for the case not to be dismissed on standing, in my opinion. Their argument holds no water. And the sooner this bullshit is over with, the better.",neutral
"I firmly believe in the romantic relationship reading of the song, but I get the sort of paternal vibes too and I genuinely think those vibes have to do with the fact that many of Taylor's very serious relationships have been with men who are significantly older than her. That's the kind of relationship dynamic you sometimes look back on and realize you thought you were equal but you never were. I think of this song and the patronizing lovers in ""tolerate it"" and ""Illicit affairs"" and just feel like those really vivid emotions have to come from somewhere.",neutral
"folklore was my favorite album of all time‚Ä¶ until evermore. Evermore is abso-fucking-lutely mind blowing.

Champagne Problems is one of the best songs on Evermore for me. I like that it is a piano ballad and Taylor's voice is so beautiful. About the lyrics, I like the story that it's told. 

That being said, I think it's very subjective which song it's the best. If you don't have a connection with it, then that's ok.",neutral
"It's really the difference in sound (hence *\*sonic\**). Red meshes Pop, Dubstep, Folk Pop, Country, Rock, Electric Pop, and more sub genres. It's supposed to feel like this.

I'm mildly convinced that 1989 was similar. Especially with all that T.S. 1989 merch that got banned in China because Tiananmen Square happened in 1989. I don't know how or where or why. But I think it happened. So there's that.",neutral

Jack Antonoff is touring mid-May through August (I think Aaron Dessner is touring w the National this summer too) so most of the recording for this year's albums will likely need to be finished by the end of April. 

There are many unknowns: 1989's legal issues, TS10, vinyl shortages. So really anything is possible. But I think two is a good bet.",neutral

"there's this thing called Twitter Spaces, which is basically a live discussion forum where Twitter users can join and talk about various things. There was a space hosted by a Twitter account and it was titled 'ArivsTay' which is a competition between both their discographies, and people vote on which song they preferred. Turns out the panelists were biased towards Ariana and the people who were representing our fandom were just Ariana fans pretending to be us in order to sabotage the votes. For the category of 'best feminist anthem' they picked Better Than Revenge üíÄ the Ariana fans had also blocked Swiftie accounts so the votes were completely altered and All Too Well literally lost one of the battles. ALL TOO WELL!! 

Anyways, Swifties understood what was going on and how it was all an unfair/biased competition and decided to start another space called 'TayvsTay' to stray away from the toxicity. We compared songs from within Taylor's discography and voted on our preferences. It was a lot less toxic and peaceful.

"Hello! I have a lot to say so I'm going to make two comments, one with the rules I followed and one with overall thoughts.¬†

**Rules**

Here are the parameters I tried to follow. You can read this Wikipedia article on [Song Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_structure) if you want to learn more.¬†

* Song¬†sections include: Verse (V, yellow), Pre-Chorus (P, orange), Chorus (C, pink), Post-Chorus (A, purple), Bridge (B, bluish-purple) and Unique Intro/Outro (I or O respectively, blue). Partially shaded squares represent short outros (see below). A different version of the same section is indicated by a number and lighter color. I included a basic¬†song¬†structure¬†on top for comparison.
* **This is an analysis of¬†structural¬†and lyrical variety**, so sections were only coded as different versions if they had new lyrics (i.e., ""You're not my homeland anymore"" vs. ""I'm not your problem anymore"" in exile). Melodic or instrumental changes in a section were not recorded as a different version (i.e., the first two choruses in coney island vs. the final ""disappointments clOSE YOUR EYES""), nor were adlibs (usually found in final choruses), or instrumental breaks.
* With that being said, melodies are how¬†song¬†sections are determined, so if a section came after the second chorus (traditionally where a bridge is located) but had the same melody as a verse or pre-chorus, I coded it as such.
* The length of the individual sections is not recorded, so the overall length of a¬†song¬†is sometimes over or under-inflated (Dear John is one of her longest songs but appears shorter than others because it has less sections). I thought about visualizing each section by measure and including instrumentals, but it proved too big of an undertaking at the moment. Maybe someday!
* If the¬†song¬†has a short outro using lyrics from another section(s), it's partially shaded and not included in the graph. However, if the outro had a unique melody and lyrics, it was coded as a unique in/outro and was included in the graph (i.e. Getaway Car),¬†even if it ended in a chorus reframe (i.e. cardigan, illicit affairs, or betty). It pained me not to count the final chorus in Ivy as a unique outro, but the melody is too similar to the chorus, so I decided to note which songs had unique lyrics in their final section, as well as some other interesting artifacts (see other comment).¬†
* The numbers used in the bar graph are the same as the ""Totals"" column on the individual album counts. As stated, the short in/outros were not included. Because each album¬†has a different number of songs, I showed the sections as a percentage of the full album.¬†",neutral
"I'm hoping there's a reason for the multiple countdowns, a single and then a release-date announcement (if not an album drop), maybe? Either way, I NEED ANSWERS.",neutral

We're sitting at the chef's counter and i look over to our left and theres this couple there. The guy is this huge gym bro. He's wearing a gray gym shirt that has red screen printed letters on it in a typical gym shirt font. ""T-SWIFT"". I look over and just say ""dude, you a swiftie?"" And he says ""fuck yeah"" but like in a ""what are you gonna do about it?"" tone. I just open my jacket to reveal my speak now tour shirt underneath. He just beams up and says ""DUDE!!!"" And we both just start laughing and give each other a high five. Our girls started talking about how funny it was that we were the swifites in our relationships instead of them.

With 1989 it was an interesting time because her music was so popular and was everywhere, but she was being picked apart by so many people (there is a clip from The View I think where one of the hosts goes on about how she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo‚Äù perfect/skinny with ‚Äúall her model friends‚Äù and how ‚Äúit‚Äôs so annoying‚Äù ‚Äî I can‚Äôt find the clip, but it‚Äôs really toxic stuff).

‚Ä¶folklore/evermore returned her to a very different place in the eyes of the GP. Without any warning she put out two albums during quarantine that really resonated with people.

"So I‚Äôve mentioned it before but Ivy and Exile fit two couples from the *Outlander* books/show. 

For context for those who aren‚Äôt familiar, the series stars Claire Beauchamp Randall who was a nurse on the front lines of WWII. The series starts just after WWII, with Claire and Frank trying to rekindle their marriage (they were separated during WWII) on a second honeymoon in Scotland. However, Scotland is a magical place and Claire accidentally ‚Äúfalls through the stones‚Äù back into the year 1743. 

While in the past, Claire starts falling in love with one of the Highlander lairds, a young man named Jamie Fraser. Without getting too much into spoilers, Claire ends up having to marry Jamie for protection. So, in essence, she‚Äôs married to two men, but one is in the 1900s and one is in the 1700s.

[This tribute uses Ivy to explore Jamie and Claire‚Äôs relationship](https://youtu.be/nnhSmMc_H9E)

when you make mistakes in a relationship they‚Äôre lessons learned, that you both can learn from, and in a healthy relationship the person to blame should take responsibility and try to do better next time.

Or maybe they‚Äôre going to therapy, but because he‚Äôs a narc instead of taking the therapists advice to better himself he uses it to just point out everything she‚Äôs doing wrong.

I‚Äôd also love to see what she could dream up if she worked with an artist who is known for their powerhouse vocals. Someone like Beyonc√© or Kelly Clarkson. Usually you see the powerhouse vocalists collaborating with each other so it would be an interesting dynamic to see someone who is vocally very gifted and technical team up with someone like Taylor, who has a gorgeous tone and emotive quality but can‚Äôt necessarily hit the high notes as well as some.

I think there's other songs on the album that could've probably gotten that same message across, but ME! is the most polar opposite song on Lover to reputation imo. 

And sure, I get the general dislike for ME! as a single, it's very poppy and kid sounding, and the video is all rainbows and pink, but I kind of think that was the intention to show the contrast between the reputation era's theming and lover's.

Just because he leans into the character he was type cast in isn't a reflection of him as a person being ""obnoxious"".

The extended video released does help add context that Kanye did indeed call to ask her to promote it (which she always said he did), she asked him to send her the song (which he seemingly never did), and that she was supremely uncomfortable the whole time as he was quite unhinged.

"I was thinking about Debut TV just yesterday. I don't think You'll always find your way back home and Diary Of Me will be included. Taylor didn't write Diary Of Me and the other was written for the movie. Also Best Day of your life I don't think is that relevant and they are all songs written in 2008. Definitely Permanent Marker, Your Face and I'd Lie. Then I think Dark Blue Tennessee (I'll be mad if she doesn't release it), Welcome Distraction, Long Time Coming. Nashville is a possibility because she wrote it in 2005 but she performed it in December 2006, so she HAS to like that song, but maybe it's wishful thinking",neutral
"I really don‚Äôt want to believe it to hard but it has some facts to it. With Taylornation and theallknower both tweeting a video and a song 4:14 is something! With 5/13 in the Stephen Colbert interview and when she was at Jimmy Fellon adds spice to it. She even asked how far is something being to far away for being announced ahead. 

Also showing her HUGE phonecase into a camera with her new merch line for evermore being the 10th one containing 14 items in the same sky blue tone with flowers is something aswell. Why showing of that gigantic phone so prominent? Why this Casetify case being one of thousands on that page. Even the one with the flowers comes in multiple shades, with matte and clear cases etc. Then the merch dropped when really nobody saw it coming as evermore had no chance for winning the Grammy. And then the page turned into that skyblue color and all the flowers. 

Yesterday a screenshot was leaked (just look the thread from @ ajayyll on Twitter) from teneo an atrl  which seems to be a reliable source. It says that rumors will be cleared soon. This adds aswell I guess. 

Then we had a picture with Lanas dad and Jack Antonov together in the studio. Then a picture of Lana‚Äôs das in the same spot playing piano saying he is creating ethereal music. Then ethereal being mentioned by Taylor at her Carolina announcement‚Ä¶it could all in all be everything and nothing.

has plenty of ‚Äúdeep cuts.‚Äù The reason that we might not consider a song a deep cut is because we are Swifties and know every song.

We‚Äôre talking about an imperfect voting system that doesn‚Äôt reward every single smash success in a given year. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

I have found the major focus on his snub in this subreddit and elsewhere completely take away from the excitement of others getting nominated and rewarded for their hard work.

Reputation had a rough go and I remember the disappointment I felt in it and I was so concerned, and then Lover came out and it gave everything context. It was so beautiful and hopeful and *her*. It‚Äôs such a great album and I truly believe it would‚Äôve had insane regard in the media had the timing been better, but as individual fans trickle backward from red tv, or people that joined in for the folkmore era, there is absolutely no way they could hit Lover and not be totally wowed ü§©",neutral

"I actually think rep and debut will be the last two, rep for legal reasons and debut because in a sense it will be coming full circle.

"In regards to the tracklisting I *really* think London boy should have been a bonus track. I personally love it's nice to have a friend, but I have no idea what state of mind Taylor was in while writing London Boy because it's a bit of a dumpster fire. 

I'm sure some people love it, but personally I would have been far happier with it if it was just a bonus track or promotional single/ one-off  like Only The Young was. Her giving it real estate in an already pack album sandwiched between much better songs was a weird choice and it always bugged me the most.",neutral
"I‚Äôm kinda hoping she takes the rest of the year off of the re-recordings. She‚Äôs been pushing out lots of content since September of 2019. She deserves a break, and I think the re-records will lose their luster if she over-saturates their releasing timing. Let us sit with the content we have for a minute and appreciate it.

"I remember listening to my 1989 vinyl on repeat when it first came out and thinking every song was a bop. I still love to sing it in my car on long drives. I believe all her albums are in a league of their own so it‚Äôs hard to compare them, but if I had to choose my favorites to listen to from start to finish, 1989 is second only to Reputation. All the songs on those two are just so fun. Clean is my second favorite TS song of all time.",neutral

"Never thought of it that way, but you‚Äôre right. We already have evermore (the song) on the album to touch upon her personal struggles in a way that fits the somber theme and soundscape.",neutral
"the lack of relief gets to me too - even with gold rush, which is amazing and more upbeat, it's ultimately daydreaming pensively about something that will never happen. ivy, cowboy like me, 'tis the damn season, all the tracks you mention, they're all either tinged with sadness/loss/melancholy or are outright heartbreaking. and I love them, they're gorgeous (*ding*), but the light never fully dawns. evermore's lyrics at the end are the first breath of it, but like you said, there's light at the end of the tunnel but it hasn't been reached yet. and then right where you left me and it's time to go are both devastating lyrically. I know folklore ends on hoax, which is one of *the* saddest, but its true ending is much more the lakes to me, and even though it has heartache too, that song's Romantic allusions/imagery and the dreamy longing/feeling that there's someone who belongs with her makes it feel cozy to me. folklore feels like a lot of reflection, quiet healing, and nostalgia, she said evermore is about endings/closure to conflicts, but it speaks more to the ache/grief/loss whenever I listen to it. it would just be so magical to have a last piece that's restoration and blossoming and renewed hope, because she's as wonderful at that as she is at heartbreak. I'm not saying that as being demanding or anything at all, it truly comes from my deep love for these albums that I would be excited for a final one, but I'm also forever grateful we have them and completely understand why she might be done and how much work it took to create them, and the rerecordings are such an important endeavor and a gift too. the passionate music lover in me just isn't quite ready to leave the folklorian woods forevermore! üå∑üçÇ",neutral
