Finally, the ROC curve, Figure 20 reveals that there is only a slight difference between each model. However, the best-performing model among all is the Random Forest, with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) value of 0.64. This suggests that Random Forest excels in distinguishing controversial comments from non-controversial ones. It achieves an accuracy of 64%, an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) value of 0.63, and an F1 score of 0.59. Based on these metrics, we can confidently conclude that the Random Forest model is the most suitable choice for predicting controversial comments, offering a balanced combination of accuracy and predictive power.
